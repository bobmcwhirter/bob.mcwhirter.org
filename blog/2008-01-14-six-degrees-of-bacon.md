Some days, there's a rhythm  to the universe, where one idea keeps bubbling to the surface, trying to make itself known.

Today is one of those days.  And the idea is <strong>bacon</strong>.

It started when I was reading some Apple rumor site about tomorrow's keynote.  The sidebar had a headline that involved "cookies" and "bacon".   That of course lead to <a href="http://neverbashfulwithbutter.blogspot.com/2007/12/experiments-in-deliciousness-bacon.html" title="Bacon cookies">Bacon Chocolate Chip Cookies with Cinnamon Maple Glaze</a>.

My buddy <a href="http://mult.ifario.us/a" title="prb's blog">Paul R. Brown</a> then shared the <a href="http://www.speakeasy.org/~sjmaks/bcb/index.html" title="BCB">Bacon Cheese Baconburger</a> with me.

Lastly, Ben (my arch-nemesis) gave me the ever-helpful <a href="http://incredimazing.com/page/Bacon_Flowchart" title="Bacon flowchart">Bacon Flowchart</a>.
