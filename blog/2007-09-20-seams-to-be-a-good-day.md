A couple of JBoss-related announcements today...

<a title="JBoss Community Calendar" href="http://labs.jboss.com/community/calendar.html">
  <img width="173" height="135" align="right" title="Picture 8.png" id="image317" alt="Picture 8.png" src="/blog/assets/Picture%208.png"/>
</a>First, if you're wanting to meet some of the JBoss guys out in the Real World, we've mashed-up Google Calendar over at our <a title="JBoss Community Calendar" href="http://labs.jboss.com/community/calendar.html">Community Calendar Page</a>.  Currently it includes some dates to meet the Drools guys in Orlando, Romania and Sao Paulo, some Hibernate guys in Atlanta, Dublin and London, and the <a title="Value2 Tour" href="http://www.redhat.com/promo/value2na/">Value2</a> tour across North America.

Additionally, Norm Richards <a title="Seam 2.0.0-CR1" href="http://in.relation.to/Bloggers/Seam200CR1HasBeenReleased">has announced Seam 2.0.0-CR1</a>.  If you've been waiting to jump on the Seam 2.x bandwagon, this is a really good time <a title="Download Seam" href="http://labs.jboss.com/jbossseam/download/index.html">to check it out</a>.  Being a candidate-release, this could quite possibly be The Real Thing.  If while digging around, you find a show-stopper of a bug, <a title="Seam Forums" href="http://www.jboss.org/index.html?module=bb=viewforum=231">let us know in the forums</a> or via <a title="JBoss Seam JIRA" href="http://jira.jboss.com/jira/browse/JBSEAM">JIRA</a>.
