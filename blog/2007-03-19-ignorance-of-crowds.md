This weekend, the wife suggested we go as a family to see the movie <em>
  <a title="Disney's site for the movie" href="http://disney.go.com/disneypictures/terabithia/">Bridge to Terabithia</a>
</em>.

I'd never heard of it, so I googled using the searchbox in Firefox.  I wasn't thinking very clearly, and just typed "<strong>road to ter</strong>" and up popped some suggestions:

Of course, the movie is named <em><strong>Bridge</strong> to Terabithia</em>, not <em><strong>Road</strong> to Terabithia</em>.

Enough folks have gotten this wrong that Google has decided to suggest leading me down the wrong path. If I actually pick one of the suggestions, perhaps I'll be encouraging Google to lead others astray. Plus, Google has provided positive reinforcement towards me thinking the movie is actually named <em>Road to Terabithia</em>, ensuring that my own ignorance is further cemented.

  <strong>Thanks Google!</strong>

Of course, I spent 98% of the movie wondering why it wasn't called <em>The Rope-swing to Terabithia</em>.
