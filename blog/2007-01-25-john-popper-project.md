<p><img src="/blog/assets/skinny_john.png" alt="Skinny John" align="left" height="260" width="102"/>After listening to <a href="http://www.radioio.com/radioiojam.php" title="radioioJam homepage">radioioJam</a> for a few days, I realized that one song kept catching my attention.  That song was <strong>Horses</strong> by the <a href="http://www.popperproject.com/" title="John Popper Project homepage">John Popper Project</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Horses</strong> has a mid-eastern flavor to it in terms of melodic intervals and phrasing from John&#x2019;s sometimes spooky voice.  In general, it&#x2019;s more processed than your typical organic Blues Traveller song.  It&#x2019;s repetitive without being reptitious, harkening back to his jam-band roots.  The drumming is intricate and multi-layered, a joy to listen to exclusively even.  John ultimately whips out an electrified harmonica solo, once again proving <strong>just how cool he is.</strong></p>
<p>Tangentially&#x2026;</p>
<p>I place John Popper into that small category of folks who radically change the rules regarding &#x201C;traditional&#x201D; instruments.  John wails on the harp and never do I imagine cowboys swilling whiskey and watching cattle.  The only other person off the top of my head in that category is Ian Anderson of Jethro Tull.  Ian does crazy and inhuman things with a flute.  Crazy, man, <strong>simply crazy</strong>.</p>
<p>Earlier on the CD is <strong>Fire In Her Kiss</strong>, which opens with the distinct sounds of DJ Logic, but quickly becomes a nice soulful tune which displays not a little influence by Hendrix.</p>
<p>A few tracks are simply a little too upbeat and sappy, in that Canadian <a href="http://www.bnlmusic.com/" title="BNL homepage">Bare Naked Ladies</a> sort of way.</p>
<p>On other songs, such as <strong>Took</strong>, Popper almost even sounds like the dude from BNL, while still retaining a non-Canadian funk.  What&#x2019;s with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian" title="Wikipedia entry on Canadians">Canadians</a>?</p>
<p>Surprisingly, John is from Ohio, not Canada.</p>
<p>I vote for Skinny John. How about you?</p>
