Oh, fortuna!

I'm rejoining the Red Hat/JBoss mothership, doing rubyish things, and what do you know, but there's a <a title="Raleigh RubyCamp" href="http://barcamp.pbwiki.com/RaleighRubyCamp">RubyCamp</a> at the RHT HQ in Raleigh on October 18th.<a title="37signals" href="http://37signals.com/"/>

<a title="37signals" href="http://37signals.com/">37signals</a> and <a title="Ruby Row" href="http://rubyrow.net/">Ruby Row</a> are sponsoring the event.<a title="Ruby Row" href="http://rubyrow.net/">
</a>

Space is limited to 200, but at the time of this posting only 57 have signed up.  It's an unconference, so bring your own good ideas, and you can lead a session
