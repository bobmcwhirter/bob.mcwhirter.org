</a>Thanks to my buddy <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/77159964@N00/293612533/in/set-72157594363107356/">Ben Walding</a>, I'm now unofficially participating in the month of <a href="http://www.movember.com.au/">Movember</a>, apparently to help raise awareness of men's health issues.

Of course, I cheated by simply trimming down an existing beard, instead of growing a mo' from scratch.  I passed through an awkward <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/openxource_bob/293260532/">Fu Manchu</a> stage before arriving at the French-inspired 'stache.
