Ever learned of something just a fraction too late behind "everyone else", causing an immediate disregard for that thing?

<img src="/blog/assets/nirvananevermindalbumcover.jpg" align="right" height="116" width="116"/>For me, the incident I remember most was the release of Nirvana's <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nevermind" title="Nirvana">Nevermind</a> album.  I prided myself on knowing cool weird bands, then <strong>boom</strong>, everyone was listening to Nirvana, and I'd somehow completely missed the boat.  Not wanting to be a "me too" I ended up never purchasing any Nirvana CDs ever.  Of course, now I remember Kurt fondly when I hear <em>Smells Like Teen Spirit</em> on the oldies radio channel ("the greatest hits of the 70s, 80s and 90s, with less talk!").

I feel like something similar may be happening with Spock.com.  I don't know if they've somehow suddenly infiltrated my social group, or if they just have a particularly wicked viral campaign (auto-sending invites to your whole address book, like Plaxo did once upon a time).  But somehow, I've gotten a dozen invites to Spock in the past week.

I'd looked at Spock a while back.  And I didn't get it.

It did not seem particularly accurate, precise or useful.  And now everyone I know is inviting me to it.

And I <strong>still</strong> don't get it.

Some new services have a gentle roll-out, where you build anticipation, hoping to get invited (ie, Dopplr, GMail).  Others seem to have a polarizing roll-out.  You either immediately buy-in or immediately become a detractor.

I'm not sure what the difference is, really.

But you can stop inviting me to Spock.
