Google selected the combined <a href="http://code.google.com/soc/2008/fedora/about.html" title="Mentoring">Fedora+JBoss.org group</a> as a mentoring organization for the <a href="http://code.google.com/soc/2008/" title="GSoC">Google Summer of Code 2008</a>.

The JBoss guys have <a href="http://labs.jboss.com/wiki/GSoC" title="JBoss GSoC Ideas">started gathering project ideas</a>.  If you're hoping to participate in the GSoC, take a look, and maybe you'll see something that'll inspire you.

If you're a student, the GSoC is a great way to spend your summer and get some bonafide open-source work under your belt.  While being paid.  Plus, you'll get to work with top-shelf Java developers like Manik Surtani, Ales Justin and Tim Fox, amongst others.

So, get thinking about your projects, because the <a href="http://code.google.com/opensource/gsoc/2008/faqs.html#0.1_student_apply" title="GSoC student applications">student application</a> window is about to open.
