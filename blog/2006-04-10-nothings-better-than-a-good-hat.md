We had the ups and downs about the Oracle acquisition rumor for JBoss.  Then that died.

This morning, I just happened to wander by the RedHat site, and what do you know, but <a href="http://www.redhat.com/promo/jboss/">they are buying JBoss</a>.  Overall, RedHat will probably be a better opensource citizen in caretaking the JBoss property, compared to Oracle.
