</a><a href="http://radarnetworks.com/" title="Radar Networks">Radar Networks</a>, my former employer, <a href="http://novaspivack.typepad.com/nova_spivacks_weblog/2007/10/radar-networks-.html" title="Nova's announcement">is finally going public</a> with what they're up to.  To be honest, at this point even I have no clue what they're launching.  I've been gone for a while, and they seem to have been massively busy and hiring the past 9 months.  I'll be watching intently, to see what they've done.
<blockquote>At the Web2.0 Summit on October 19th, Radar Networks will announce a revolutionary new service that uses the power of the emerging Semantic Web to enable a smarter way of sharing, organizing and finding information. Founder and CEO Nova Spivack will also give the first public preview of Radar&#xE2;&#x20AC;&#x2122;s application, which is one of the first examples of &#xE2;&#x20AC;&#x153;Web 3.0&#xE2;&#x20AC;&#x9D; &#xE2;&#x20AC;&#x201C; the next-generation of the Web, in which the Web begins to function more like a database, and software grows more intelligent and helpful.</blockquote>
