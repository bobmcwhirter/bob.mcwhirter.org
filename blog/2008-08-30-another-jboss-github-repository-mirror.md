For those of you playing along at home, I've added <strong>jboss-deployers</strong> to my GitHub mirror set.  Like the others, the 'vendor' branch is the one you want.
<ul>
	<li><a title="jboss-deployers" href="http://github.com/bobmcwhirter/jboss-deployers/tree/vendor">jboss-deployers</a></li>
	<li><a title="jbossas" href="http://github.com/bobmcwhirter/jbossas/tree/vendor">jbossas</a></li>
	<li><a title="microcontainer" href="http://github.com/bobmcwhirter/microcontainer/tree/vendor">microcontainer</a></li>
	<li><a title="vfs" href="http://github.com/bobmcwhirter/vfs/tree/vendor">vfs</a></li>
</ul>
I'm adding JBoss projects to my mirror set as I trip across the need to browse their source.  If there's a JBoss project you'd like to see mirrored out of SVN, drop the URL to the <strong>trunk</strong> of the SVN repository in a comment on this post, and I'll start slurping it.
