Tomorrow, I'm trekking down from my mountain to the flatlands, destined for Raleigh.

<a href="http://barcamp.org/FUDConRaleigh2008" title="FUDCon Raleigh 2008">FUDCon Raleigh 2008</a> is taking place. In the interest of Red Hat open-source communities playing friendly and synergizing, I've been invited to join the Fedora Board.  This means I've also installed VMWare Fusion and have built a Fedora image for my Mac.

Luckily, I'll also be coordinating with <a href="http://www.iquaid.org/" title="Karsten's blog">Karsten Wade</a> about some of plans for JBossWorld, which the Red Hat team is pitching in on.

It'll also be a chance for me to meet a <a href="http://cheyenneweaver.com/" title="Cheyenne's site">newly-hired designer</a> on my team, and <a href="http://opensourcepbx.tmcnet.com/topics/open-source/articles/17170-open-source-software-company-red-hat-appoints-new.htm" title="Our Fearless Leader">the new CEO of Red Hat</a>.  Amazingly, he and I went to the same small high-school in the same po-dunk Georgia town of Columbus.   Tom's Peanuts, RC Cola, Carmike Cinemas, and AFLAC.  That's Columbus.
