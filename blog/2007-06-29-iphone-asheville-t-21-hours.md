Went out for a Venti(tm) dirty chai tea latte, and decided to scope out the Cingular/AT store that will be carrying iPhones tomorrow.  Asheville is not a very large town, so we don't expect many phones to come in.

But these two guys will definitely get one.

The lucky First Guy In Line is Greg Mayer from <a title="Charlotte Street Computers" href="http://www.charlottestreetcomputers.com/">Charlotte Street Computers</a> here in town.

I'll take them some sausage, egg and cheese biscuits in the morning, unless the coyotes have already eaten these guys in the night.
