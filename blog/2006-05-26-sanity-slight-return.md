</a><span class="imagelink">Through the kick-ass efforts of Ben Walding (pictured left with his, um, jaffles iron...) and major assists by <a title="Contegix" href="http://www.contegix.com/">Contegix</a>, sanity has started to return to the haus.  All repositories are capable of being open for business, pending the project despots decision.  So, if CVS/Subversion is missing, go bug the project lead.</span>

We've got all project mail flowing again, with a <a title="Manage your email!" href="http://xircles.codehaus.org/manage_email">new web-based management piece</a> for subscribing and unsubscribing.  While the downtime sucked more than most things can suck, we're coming back with better tooling and infrastructure.  This is mostly the result of not being willing to reconfigure all of our projects by hand.  So we've scripted the heck out of things.

<img align="right" title="newhaus.png" id="image48" alt="newhaus.png" src="/blog/assets/newhaus.png?1148532859"/>We're still working on personal and project webspace.  Previous sites should be up, except those using plain HTML.  Any Confluence-backed site is good to go. All projects are currently restricted from producing new distributions on <a href="http://dist.codehaus.org/">dist.codehaus.org</a>, but we're quickly working towards a solution for that.  Pretty soon the front <a href="http://www.codehaus.org/">codehaus.org</a> page will return to its normally scheduled programming.

Plus, we've got a new logo.  Everything goes better with a new logo.
