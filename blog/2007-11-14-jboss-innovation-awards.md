While there's other opportunities for the projects at JBoss <a href="http://www.infoworld.com/slideshow/2007/09/114-best_of_open_so-4.html" title="Best App Server Ever!">to get the nod</a> for their innovation, the Innovation Awards are a chance for you, the users of JBoss projects, to get some glory.  That glory includes a free pass to the conference, a VIP dinner, and some special attention during the conference.

What's interesting about what you're doing?  There's 8 different categories, surely you fit into at least one.
<ol>
	<li><strong>Joint Red Hat/JBoss Deployment:</strong> Everyone deploys their Java stuff on Linux.  If that's JBossAS and RHEL for you, you're ready to rock.</li>
	<li><strong>SOA Implementation:</strong> Are you using JBossESB, Drools, JBoss WebServices, jBPM?</li>
	<li><strong>Increased ROI:</strong> Ask your CIO/CFO.</li>
	<li><strong>Ecosystem:</strong> The whole ecosystem around Seam/JSF could be ripe for an award here.</li>
	<li><strong>Emerging Technologies:</strong> Have you been doing Seam with Groovy?</li>
	<li><strong>Migration:</strong> Have you ditched your app-server from one of the Other Guys lately?</li>
	<li><strong>Business Process Automation:</strong> Did you implement jBPM or Drools?</li>
	<li><strong>User Experience:</strong> Did you produce a slick UI using Portal, RichFaces and AJAX?</li>
</ol>
The Innovation Awards are a chance to highlight the good work your team has been doing.  You've got until the end of the month to send us your story using the simple form at the <a href="http://jbossworld.com/jbia/#anchor" title="Innovation Awards form">bottom of this page</a>.
