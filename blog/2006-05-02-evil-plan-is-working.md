Since then, I've been training my wife to know everything there is to know about consumer usage of a Mac. Now my father-in-law has retired, and I steered him towards a MacBook Pro.

My evil plan came together tonight as I sat idly on the couch flipping through an eWeek, while my wife gave tech-support to her father. I love it when a plan comes together.
