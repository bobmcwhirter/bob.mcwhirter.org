Get your flying pants on.  You <strong>do</strong> have flying pants, <strong>don't you</strong>?

Anyhow, it's the 21st century, and I have a son on the verge of turning 10 (10?! holy crap).  Definitely time to start some advanced father/son projects.  But I'm a project-based worker anyhow, and a geek to boot.  So this father/son project will be an agile project and have a blog.

<strong>What is this project</strong>?

For Christmas, Noah got a Flywheels XPV.  It's a hunk of foam with 2 fans and a remote control.  It's neat.  But we decided we could do better.   So we're going to be building our very own from-scratch flying machine.

As mentioned above, there's a blog.  <a href="http://flyingpants.org/2007/01/03/the-art-of-flying/">It's all explained there</a>.  So I hereby announce <a title="Flying Pants!" href="http://flyingpants.org/">FlyingPants.org</a>.

And yes, it completely goes against my own point about <a title="Karma Columnist" href="/blog/karma-columnist">syndicating columnists instead of running special-purpose blogs</a>.  I'm allowed to change my mind.
