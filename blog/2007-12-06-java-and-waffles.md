<img src="/blog/assets/800px-waffle_dsc00575.jpg" align="right" height="84" width="146"/>In about 24 hours I'll be jetting towards Antwerp, Belgium to attend <a href="http://www.javapolis.com/confluence/display/JP07/Home" title="JavaPolis">JavaPolis</a>.  I'll also be meeting most of my team for the first time, as the development stars from Poland wing their way westward.

JBoss has a booth, and a bundle of core developers (and management) will either be attending or <a href="http://www.javapolis.com/confluence/display/JP07/Speakers" title="JavaPolis speakers">speaking</a>.
