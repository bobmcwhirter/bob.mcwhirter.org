Alas, it's been a bad month for opensource communities.  SourceForge has had its share of problems lately, as did the ASF.  And now, even the Codehaus is not immune.  Our CVS/Subversion server is offline with an angry disk.  We're trying to recover it, but preparing to restore from backups if need be.  We have no ETA at the moment, but real-time updates will be available on <strong>irc.codehaus.org</strong> in the #codehaus channel.

We apologize to users who are left out in the cold, particularly those using maven with missing repos.  I also hope no demos at JavaOne assumed we'd be online.  Eh, what can you do?   Plans for migrating the functionality of this machine to a shiny new box at <a title="Contegix" href="http://www.contegix.com/">Contegix</a> are under way.
