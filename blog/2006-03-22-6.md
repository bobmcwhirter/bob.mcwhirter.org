Congrats to Sam Pullara and his team at <a href="http://www.gauntletsystems.com/">Gauntlet Systems</a> on their <a href="http://www.borland.com/us/company/news/press_releases/2006/03_20_06_borland_acquires_gauntlet_systems.html">recent acquisition by Borland</a>.  Nothing sucks worse than a broken build, and Gauntlet seems to have taken continuous integration into a nicely packaged commercial software-as-a-service offering.  Let's hope Borland doesn't screw it up.  Anyone remember Together/J?
