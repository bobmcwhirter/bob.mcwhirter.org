Earlier this week, Katie Poplin sent out the notifications to people who submitted presentation proposals for <a title="JBoss World" href="http://jbossworld.com/">JBoss World 2008</a>.  The official schedule will be posted later, but I'm happy to say that my proposal for a <a title="JBoss.org" href="http://jboss.org/">JBoss.org</a> round-table discussion about running open-source projects was accepted.

I'll be drafting some core developers, external contributors and users of JBoss projects to discuss the various aspects of OSS projects.  We'll compare the differences between projects that have community origins to those with corporate origins.  We'll look into the different management styles of both communities and projects.  We'll get some feedback from users and contributors, to provide a different perspective.  It should be interesting.

Additionally, JBoss.org will be sponsoring a hackathon.  This will provide a place for developers who seldom (if ever) meet in person to get together and write some code.  Hackathons are a great way to learn a lot in a short amount of time or to knock out a major feature or improvement on a project.  We'll be publishing more information about this soon, along with a wiki page in case anyone would like to coordinate their activities.
