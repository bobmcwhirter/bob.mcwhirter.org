Today, I took the wife on a lunch date to the newly opened restaurant <strong>Nine Mile</strong> in Asheville.  I'd give a link, but their web designer is apparently slack.  The restaurant is run by Aaron, husband of my web-designer friend <a href="http://juneallison.com/" title="June's portfolio">June</a>.

The atmosphere was excellent, mellow with some reggae music.  We got an excellent seat by the window.  "Nine Mile" is a tribute to Bob Marley, and the Caribbean atmosphere translates well without being at all campy.  There's no faux palm huts to be found anywhere.  Instead, the walls are adorned with rich abstract art, and a portrait of Marley.   There's a lot of Jerk sauce on the menu, plenty of pasta, vegan-friendly dinners and desserts (provided by <a href="http://www.butterbugs.com/" title="Butterbugs">Butterbugs</a>).

Rebecca got the <em>Nigril Nights</em>, a tangy pasta dish with the finest rare tuna we've seen in a long time.  You could taste the freshness and the fantastic flavor of the fish.  I got <em>One Foundation</em> which included nicely grilled and sliced chicken over noodles with a creamy sauce.  It was augmented by pineapple and peppers.

The portions were generous, the staff super-friendly, and the atmosphere lovely, looking out the windows at the old houses of Montford.

Plus, I got to wash it all down with Cheerwine.  <em>Cheerwine!</em>

Overall, I highly recommend Nine Mile, and not just because June's a buddy.

It's located at 233 Montford Avenue in Asheville.  Super convenient if you're in Montford for <a href="http://www.montfordfestival.com/Festival/" title="Montford Music &amp; Arts Festival">the Music &amp; Arts Festival</a>.
