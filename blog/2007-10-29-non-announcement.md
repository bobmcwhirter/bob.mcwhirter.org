A year from today, I'll be 35.

That'll make me eligible to be the President of the United States.  I had planned on announcing my web2.0 candidacy, and do a <a href="http://www.zefrank.com/thewiki/Main_Page" title="Ze Frank wiki">Ze Frank</a>-esque 1-year internship of running for president.  I even registered a domain, "designed" a logo, and planned on doing a write-in campaign to demonstrate the power of the hype of New Media.

But in my research, I discovered 4 things:
<ol>
	<li><a href="http://www.indecision2008.com/blog.jhtml?c=v&amp;m=90881" title="Something about Colbert">Stephen Colbert</a> is running for president, so I don't stand a chance.</li>
	<li>Even a write-in candidacy requires a crapload of paperwork and signatures and stuff.</li>
	<li>Being a libertarian, it'd be ironic to try to be President and force my views of government on the population.</li>
	<li>There's this thing called <a href="http://unity08.org/" title="Unity08">Unity08</a>, trying to do an end-run around the 2-party system.  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Waterston" title="Sam Waterston">The guy from Law &amp; Order</a> (and TD Ameritrade commercials) is their spokesperson.  Getting a Unity08 nomination means that someone else handles the election paperwork.</li>
</ol>
So, today, I do <strong>not</strong> announce my run for President.  But I'll consider it if someone nominates me for the Unity08 "party".

I do hope I get an invite to <a href="http://www.twine.com/" title="Twine">Twine</a> today, though.

And maybe some cake.  I like cake.
