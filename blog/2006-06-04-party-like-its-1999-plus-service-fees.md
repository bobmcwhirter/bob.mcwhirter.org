</a>Last night at the Best Buy, I picked up Phish's <a href="http://stores.musictoday.com/store/product.asp?band_id=840=5119=PH16COMBO=7">NYE'95</a> show, which is quite a nice 3-disc set.  As <a href="http://www.ebglaw.com/atty_bio_682.htm">my attorney</a> says, wouldn't it be great if every show was like a New Year's Eve show?  While listening to it, I started surfing and found a <a href="http://www.phish.com/news/index.php?year=2006#story315">nice tidbit</a> about a show with <a href="http://www.thephilzone.com/">Phil Lesh  Friends</a> in Asheville.  Mike of Phish will be there along with the recently-blogged <a href="http://www.beneventorussoduo.com/">Benevento/Russo Duo</a>.  That's awesome.

I pinged my attorney, and his wife is letting him out of the house for a jamband road trip up to Asheville.  I remember the days of it being difficult to get Dead tickets (though, I've been close enough to see Jerry sweating all over his guitar) so was quite pleased to find tickets still availlable for this Asheville show.  Alas, through Ticketmaster.  But after being suitably brutalized by their "service fees", I've got 2 tickets en-route.

(And yes, referring to my school buddy as "my attorney" is an affectation and reference to <a href="http://www.gonzo.org/">Hunter S. Thompson</a>.)
