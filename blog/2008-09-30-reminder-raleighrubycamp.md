Don't forget, in a few weeks at the <a title="Red Hat in Raleigh" href="http://www.redhat.com/about/contact/ww/americas/raleigh.html">Red Hat offices in Raleigh</a>, there will be an unconference-style <a title="RaleighRubyCamp" href="http://barcamp.pbwiki.com/RaleighRubyCamp">Ruby BarCamp</a> on October 18th.

  </a>

My plan is to put together a few clumps of slides, prepare a cluster on EC2, and see if anyone wants to hear about JBoss Rails.  I'll of course put them online sometimes before/during/after the camp, since that's <a title="BarCamp rules" href="http://barcamp.pbwiki.com/TheRulesOfBarCamp">part of the rules</a>.
