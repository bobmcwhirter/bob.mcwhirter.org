Thanks to the typical <a title="Damn you, Amazon" href="/blog/run-level-run">demo demons</a>, I've been unable to get everything functioning perfect for instantaneous clustering on EC2 by tomorrow.

Oh well.

But here's the <a href="http://fnokd.com/~bob/jboss-rails-cloud-rubycamp.pdf">first draft of some slides</a> I'm taking with me to the Raleigh RubyCamp.

It's a BarCamp style event, so I anticipate the slides probably changing throughout the day.  I'll published updates if needed.
