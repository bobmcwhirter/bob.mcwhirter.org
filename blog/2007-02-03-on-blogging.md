<img width="141" height="152" align="right" title="Brian" id="image154" alt="Brian" src="/blog/assets/Picture%204.png"/>My good friend <a title="Brian" href="http://kasparov.skife.org/blog/">Brian "I love a good tamale" McCallister</a> apparently <a title="Party of the first part" href="http://kasparov.skife.org/blog/stuff/blogging-enjoyably.html">blogged</a> about a blog entry that <a title="Henri" href="http://blog.generationjava.com/roller/bayard/">Hernri</a> <a title="Party of the second part" href="http://blog.generationjava.com/roller/bayard/entry/200702022">wrote</a> about an IM conversation he had with Brian.

  <strong>That's so meta.</strong>

<p align="left">They both made the point that they haven't enjoyed blogging because it felt like they were writing articles.  It gets tiring sounding <a title="Definition" href="http://dictionary.reference.com/search?r=2=pedagogical">pedagogical</a> all the time.</p>
<p align="left">But when you blog about work all the time, and define yourself by the work you do, it's easy to fall into the <strong>CompSci Professor mindset</strong>.  You learned something new or figured something out, and so you want to teach others.  That's cool and awesome, but can wear you out after a while.</p>
<p align="left">For the past while, I worked at an uber-stealth web 3.0 start-up.  By definition, I couldn't blog about my job.  I stopped blogging for a while.  But the urge to write kept coming back.  I had to instead focus it on non-work topics.  Like music.  Or random observations.  Or mental musings on different ideas.</p>
<p align="left">So, if you're finding it difficult to summon the will to blog, take a moment and look at your blogging habits.  Have you historically been a "<a title="java.blogs" href="http://www.javablogs.com/Welcome.action">Java blogger</a>" and written about things that somehow relate back to your work?  Then go have a beer with a non-Geek friend, watch the sunset,  have a good discussion.  Then blog about that.  Instead of trying to explain why nobody should use <a title="RoR Rocks, buddy" href="http://www.rubyonrails.org/">Ruby on Rails</a>, try to make a similar argument as to why <a title="It is crap" href="http://www.amazon.com/Conch-Dig-Moe/dp/B000KHYODM">moe's new CD</a> sucks.</p>
<p align="left">Expand your domain.  You are more than the job you perform.  Your blog should be also.</p>
<p align="left">When in doubt, just include a goofy photo or illustration to distract readers from the lack of content.</p>
<p align="left">But try to avoid blogging about your cat.  Nobody cares.</p>
