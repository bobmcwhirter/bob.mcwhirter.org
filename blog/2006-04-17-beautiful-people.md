<img width="216" height="161" align="left" alt="Photo 24.jpg" id="image17" title="Photo 24.jpg" src="/blog/assets/Photo%2024.jpg"/>This weekend, I purchased a wacky cool MacBook Pro for my wife.  The included PhotoBooth tool seems pretty useless, if not entertaining.  For example, even I can have a strong chin and wonderful hair.  Of course, it sucks that my non-geek wife now has a better machine than I do.
