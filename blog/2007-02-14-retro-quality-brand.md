Of course I find the huge freaking tub of ibuprofen we picked up at Target a while ago.  But I'm looking for aspirin. I finally open the right cabinet and find that distinctive aspirin-bottle-shaped bottle of aspirin.  While returning to her, I started thinking about the packaging of aspirin.

Aspirin is certainly a commodity.  The entire contents of the bottle (250 tablets) probably cost someone a dime to manufacture in Malaysia.  There's no licensing fee for the formula and it's not very exotic.  At one point, you would've had to license the Aspirin trademark, but that's <a title="Aspirin(tm)" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspirin#Aspirin_as_genericized_trademark">no longer the case</a>.  Sure, <a title="Bufferin(R)" href="http://www.novartis.com/consumerhealth/OTC/Bufferin.shtml">Bufferin(R)</a> has overcome some technical issues, effectively creating a better mouse-trap.  But that probably means it costs a nickel more to manufacture.

How do you differentiate your aspirin from everyone else's?  By making people feel good about taking good ol' old-fashioned aspirin.  Like your grandmother used to use take. Ultimately, aspirin <strong>is</strong> a pretty good pain reliever.  Newer doesn't necessarily mean better.  Just ask anyone who's now having to take <a title="You can Pretend it's Effective" href="http://www.sudafed.com/faq.html">Sudafed PE</a>.

The good old days remind us of hand-crafted quality.  Our forefathers didn't put up with no guff or fancy crap.  Back in their day, aspirin worked and was all they needed (nevermind that <a title="BC Powder" href="http://www.bcpowder.com/BCStory.aspx">BC Powder</a> upstart).  Since the contents of the bottle cost a dime, spend a tad more on a bottle and labeling that reflects the good ol' days before these new-fangled pain relievers confused the scene.

It's worked for Crew and their pomades and tonics.  Why not for aspirin? Tell a story of a simpler time!  <a title="Pepperidge Farm History" href="http://www.pepperidgefarm.com/history_1970s.asp">Pepperidge Farm remembers</a>!

Of course, most folks would just refill the nifty bottle from the Mongo-Sized 50,000 tablet barrel they picked up at Costco.
