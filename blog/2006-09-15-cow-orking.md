Wow.

I'm finally home after a trip to San Francisco to meet my co-workers.  It truly was surreal, in that I've been working for <a href="http://www.radarnetworks.com/">The Job</a> for about a year, and had never met a co-worker, aside from Pete.  When I joined, the team was 3 other people, and we were all in different states.  New York.  North Carolina.  Michigan, California.

Now we are 18.

This is the first funded startup I've been a part of, and it's been fun to watch the growth of a company.  I think we've assembled an excellent team of talented individuals.  It certainly <a href="http://blogs.sun.com/gonzo/">is a</a> <a href="http://osi.fotap.org/">rather</a> <a href="http://karenmarcelo.org/">eclectic</a> <a href="http://novaspivack.typepad.com/">group</a> (no, the children are <strong>not</strong> employees).

It is somewhat strange being the odd-man-out, clear across the country.  This trip through, to finally meet everyone, helped solidify the realness of it all.  When everyone is in different states, you've got a hip <em>distributed</em> team.  When there's just one guy in the hills near the moonshine shack, he's just a <a href="http://webworkerdaily.com/">
  <em>remote worker</em>
</a>.   Ultimately, I wouldn't trade my grits and banjos for the world, and am grateful that an organization such as Radar is jiggy enough to keep a hillbilly round.  But while proximity doesn't matter to <a href="http://subversion.tigris.org/">Subversion</a> or <a href="http://www.jabber.org/">Jabber</a>, we are all humans, and faces do matter.

I'd like to travel out there more often, and I aim to finally locate and hook up the iSight.

The point to this post?  Technology allows you to never actually meet humans, but I wouldn't recommend it.
