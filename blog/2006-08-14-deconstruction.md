</a>Sometimes you just need to take stuff apart.  Stuff that has been nailed up, painted over, glued on, or otherwise mystically attached to something you wish it to no longer be attached to.  Enter the <strong>Wonderbar</strong>.  Not just any Wonderbar, but the <a href="http://www.stanleytools.com/default.asp?TYPE=PRODUCT=55-525">
  <strong>Super Wonderbar</strong>
</a>.  A Super Wonderbar is like a normal Wonderbar, but with a few extra bends, which jacks the price up a few dollars.

While many folks seem happy with a normal crow-bar, the Wonderbar is truly a work of intelligent engineering.  Being flat, it slips much easier between parts you wish to separate.  With the multitude of bends, you can easily jab it where it needs to go and still have plenty of leverage for the ripping and tearing.  The notches are beveled just right to grab even the most obstinate nail.

Of course, buying one with cash at your local Lowe's still produces a receipt longer than the tool itself.
