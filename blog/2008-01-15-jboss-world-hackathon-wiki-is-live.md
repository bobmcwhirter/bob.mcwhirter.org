As <a href="/blog/jboss-world-roundtable-and-hackathon" title="Hackathon!">mentioned previously</a>, at the <a href="http://jbossworld.com/" title="JBoss World 2008">JBoss World 2008</a> conference in Orlando, we'll be running a Hackathon.

</a>

Now's the time to head over to the <a href="http://2249.atlassian.com/display/HACK/Home" title="Hackathon wiki!">Hackathon wiki</a>, and start making some plans. If you haven't <a href="http://jbossworld.com/register/" title="Register for JBoss World">bought your pass to JBoss World yet</a>, you need to jump on that, also.  There's less than a month before we're all hanging out in sunny Florida with the gators and Canadians.  The <a href="http://jbossworld.com/agenda/" title="JBoss World Agenda">agenda is published</a>, so you can see that you'll be missing a lot if you don't come.
