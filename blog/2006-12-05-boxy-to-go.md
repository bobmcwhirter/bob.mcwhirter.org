<img width="119" height="110" align="left" alt="Picture 11.png" id="image105" title="Picture 11.png" src="/blog/assets/Picture%2011.png"/>Being an OSX user, I've felt massive amounts of unlove from TiVo, in terms of the TiVoDesktop, TiVoToGo, etc.  But now, man, the guys behind <a href="http://tivodecode.sourceforge.net/">tivodecode</a> have come to my rescue.  While playing with it, I also discovered that the TiVo actually produces a nice XML feed, and mine at least attempts to serve up some RSS (but it ultimately fails).

<strong>tivodecode</strong> spews out MPEG-2, which QuickTime can't handle natively.  You can <a href="http://www.apple.com/quicktime/mpeg2/">spend $19.99 at the Apple Store</a> to get the MPEG codec pack, or use <a href="http://darwinports.opendarwin.org/">DarwinPorts</a> to install <a href="http://www.mplayerhq.hu/design7/news.html">MPlayer</a>, which handles MPEG-2 just fine.  For free.

Bless all those opensouce geeks out there in the world.  Bless each and every one of you.
