Since I've been with JBoss, we've been making a move towards "the Fedora model" in terms of the divide between the open-source community projects and the "official" bits you can buy support against.  Once we introduced our Platforms and Frameworks product configurations, it became slightly less clear what was what.  Unlike Fedora, when tends to aggregate a lot of things from a lot of projects, the JBoss community projects are the primary upstream source for JBoss commercial support offerings.

Working with Jon Atkins and <a href="http://connollyshaun.blogspot.com/" title="Shaun's blog">Shaun Connolly</a> who handle the .com side of the house, we've <a href="http://labs.jboss.com/projects/community-enterprise.html" title=".org's statement">worked up</a> some <a href="http://jboss.com/products/community-enterprise" title=".com's statement">statements</a> to help try to clarify it all.  Additionally, James Cobb whipped up a pretty intuitive diagram demonstrating the way the open-source community is cherry-picked and how the rough edges are sanded off to create the supported bits.
