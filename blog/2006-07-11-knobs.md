Today I realized that I hadn't been listening to anything at all, because iTunes simply never made it to the front of my stack of windows. With the physical iPod situated in front of me, I'm more apt to pick something to listen to.

Digital isn't always better.  Sometimes a big-ass knob on a distinct device is functionally better than a whizzy-bang brushed metal UI without a dedicated knob.

Yes, I know the iPod doesn't have a knob.  It has an iKnob (aka, the clickwheel with the nipple in the middle).  But it's knobesque nonetheless.  And the screen is always visible.  No repeated command-tab to find it.  It's just right there.  On the desk.
