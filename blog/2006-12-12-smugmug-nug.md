</a>Over thanksgiving, my brother loaned me a <a href="http://www.nikonusa.com/template.php?cat=1=5=25206">Nikon D100</a>.  This is my first foray into digital photography beyond using my shoephone's camera to take blurry snapshots of strange supermarket items.

Sending photos to Flickr, I'm finding I'm going to exceed the limits of their free-ride accounts.  My first thought was "oh, I should go FlickrPro".  Then I decided to check out some other services before I go about spending money.

Currently I'm checking out <a href="http://bobmcwhirter.smugmug.com/gallery/2230926">SmugMug</a>.

So far, I like the slideshow feature.  I think I like the themeability, but then again, I reckon I just want a Flickr theme.  I like the fact I can have multiple galleries. The downside to multiple galleries, though, is I no longer have just "my flickr," but rather "my foo gallery on my smugmug."  Flickr's concepts of sets as pulling from a global gallery as an organizational tool may make more sense in the long run.  It's not about what gallery a photo lives in, but which collection(s) the photographer has chosen to display it in.

Of course, as my wife said, "but everyone else is on Flickr".
