Today I've relaunched (yet again) my blog.

I'm trying to retire my old *fnokd.com* domain, because it's hard to
type, hard to spell, and doesn't really mean anything.

So, in trying to shuffled everything over to *mcwhirter.org*, I've
now got the Fnokd! site ported over to [Awestruct](http://awestruct.org/).

I'm tired of differentiating *work* from *personal*.  So, now I'll be
blogging whatever seems appropriate, at the appropriate locations.

For those of you keeping track at home, that includes this blog,
along with

- <http://cloudpress.org/>
- <http://torquebox.org/>
- <http://rubyunderground.org/>
- <http://awestruct.org/>
