Today I've relaunched (yet again) my blog.

I'm trying to retire my old *fnokd.com* domain, because it's hard to
type, hard to spell, and doesn't really mean anything.

So, in trying to shuffled everything over to *mcwhirter.org*, I've
now got the Fnokd! site ported over to [Awestruct](http://awestruct.org/).

This includes some modifications to Awestruct to support cool stuff like
[tag clouds](/blog/tags).  Pretty happy with how dynamic a static site can 
be.  Mix in [IntenseDebate](http://intensedebate.com/) for comments, and
a pile of static files works impressively well.

For those of you keeping track at home, that means you can find stuff
I write here and at a variety of other places:

- <http://cloudpress.org/>
- <http://torquebox.org/>
- <http://rubyunderground.org/>
- <http://awestruct.org/>
