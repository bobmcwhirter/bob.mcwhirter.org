</a>Shortly after the marriage of JBoss and RedHat, the <a href="http://www.jbossworld.com/index.htm">JBossWorld</a> conference will be happening in Las Vegas.  Rebecca and I will be flying out there to hang out with Michael Neale and Mark Proctor of the Drools project.  If you find yourself in Vegas around mid-June, look me up and we'll have a beer.
