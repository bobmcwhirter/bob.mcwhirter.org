</a>My <a href="http://www.radarnetworks.com/index.html">Day-Job</a> has been secreted behind a wall of secret secrecy.  It still is.  But we have a new website tonight.  There's a tad more information than previously disclosed, but only a little.  You can learn a little bit about <a href="http://www.radarnetworks.com/about/index.html">our investors and our management team</a>.   Meanwhile, we're still heads-down cranking out the best massively-scalable ferumnibiting osteobithorpolexer you'll ever have seen.  I've already said too much.  If I disclose anything else, I'll be sure to be receiving The Memo.  And we wouldn't want that.
