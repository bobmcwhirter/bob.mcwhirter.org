<img width="165" height="220" align="right" title="Hand Cancer" id="image133" alt="Hand Cancer" src="/blog/assets/handXs.jpg"/>It seems the debate about links between brain cancer and cellphones goes back and forth.  It seems like last year, they were declared safe.  Now that is <a title="Cellphone Cancer Article" href="http://gizmodo.com/gadgets/cellphones/yet-another-study-cellphones-could-be-as-dangerous-as-cigarettes-230365.php">once again being called into question</a>.

But are folks missing half of the equation?  Sure, the phone is next to our head, but it's also being held by our hands.  And kids these days are sometimes holding the phone with both hands while texting, keeping their noggins safe from the brain-warming effects of radiation.

Who is studying the potential link between cellphone usage and hand cancer?

Mostly, I just liked this image.
