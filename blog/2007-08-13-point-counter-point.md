<img width="94" height="107" align="right" alt="pablum_top.jpg" id="image290" title="pablum_top.jpg" src="/blog/assets/pablum_top.jpg"/>Yesterday, Seth Godin <a title="Is good enough enough?" href="http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2007/08/is-good-enough-.html">blogged about going beyond "good enough,"</a> if you're trying to do something extraordinary.

Today, WebWorkerDaily <a title="Tip: Satisficing is good enough" href="http://webworkerdaily.com/2007/08/13/tip-satisficing-is-good-enough/">blogged about the joys of "satisficing"</a> and settling for "good enough."

And my dad always says "the enemy of 'good' is 'better'," such that if you have something good, many times you screw it up by trying to make it "just a little bit better."

The Wikipedia even has a page on the <a title="Principle of Good Enough" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_good_enough">Principle of Good Enough</a>.

I'd do some analysis, but I figured providing the links was all that was <a title="Necessary  Sufficient" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Necessary_and_sufficient_conditions">necessary and sufficient</a>.
