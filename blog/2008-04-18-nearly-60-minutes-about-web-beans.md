Gavin King recently gave a talk down in Canberra, Australia.  The kindly folks from Red Hat down there organized some filming.  Many thanks to our upside-down friends with the Queen Mother on their money.

Gavin provides an exceptionally nice walk-through behind not just how Web Beans works, but why it works the way it does.  He provides comparison to AOP features, and even demonstrates the recursive nature of Web Beans functionality being used to define Web Beans functionality.  Meta-annotations are cool.  Meta-meta-annotations are even cooler.

We've broken the talk into 3 easy-to-digest chunks:
