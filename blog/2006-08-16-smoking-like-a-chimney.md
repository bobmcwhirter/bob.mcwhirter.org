</a>Continuing the trend of physical-world things you can buy at Lowe's, I'd like to sing the praise of the charcoal chimney.

This summer, I decided to start grilling with actual chunks-of-wood charcoal, instead of pressed-and-formed McCharcoal Briquettes (now made with all white meat).   Real charcoal does not include the mass-load of volatile organic compounds that the "match-light" briquettes have.  I started by dousing it with liberal amounts of charcoal starter fluid, and whoosh, I'd eventually get an uneven grilling bed.

After picking up a few copies of <a href="http://www.cooksillustrated.com/">Cook's Illustrated</a> (check out July's centerfold), I learned of the <span style="font-style: italic">charcoal chimney</span>.  A few sheets of newspaper or discarded resumes you got from some goons on Craigslist, and your charcoal is evenly nice and toasty within 20 minutes.  It's a beautiful and simple design.  I have no idea why I never tried one sooner.
