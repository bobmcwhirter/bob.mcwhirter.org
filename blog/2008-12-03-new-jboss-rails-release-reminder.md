Just a reminder, in case anyone didn't make the jump..

My Ruby/Rails/JBoss blogging is going on over at <a title="Odd Thesis" href="http://oddthesis.org/">Odd Thesis</a> these days.

That includes <a title="JBoss-Rails 1.0.0-Beta-2 release announcement" href="http://oddthesis.org/posts/2008-12-jboss-rails-1-0-beta-2-released">this announcement</a> about the 1.0.0-Beta-2 release that just popped.
