</a><a href="http://osi.fotap.org/">Pete</a> told me about this <a href="http://oralpixation.com/">oralpixation</a> project.  I'm a big fan of <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/openxource_bob/">random pictures</a> from a <a href="http://www.nokiausa.com/phones/6620">shoephone</a>. I think I'll have to participate.  Of course, it could just be an April Fool's joke.

But that shouldn't stop folks from doing it.
