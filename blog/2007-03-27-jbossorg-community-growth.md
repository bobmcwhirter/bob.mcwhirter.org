As noted previously, many of our projects are capable of sustaining a vibrant sub-community.  This includes portlets, ESB connectors, side-projects like Drools.NET, things to jack into JCA, or even our growing collection of JSF things.

There's activity related to these communities that .ORG needs to support.  We'll be making it easier for these friendly community projects to have a home and promote themselves.  We'll be offering our services to the core projects to seed some of these community projects.  We need some Portlets and JSF components, too.  We try to eat our own dogfood where appropriate.  And sometimes we just like having fun (I've got a Portlet driver for JRuby lingering on my hard-drive, for example).

A lot of these projects are ripe for external contributions around the edges. Fostering these small, independent extensions to our core products is crucial.  So we'll be building out more of the infrastructure/forge side, to give these projects homes and visibility.  And we'll be helping with the human interactions to build communities.
