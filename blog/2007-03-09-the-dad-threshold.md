<img width="196" height="137" align="right" title="dad_threshold.png" id="image189" alt="dad_threshold.png" src="/blog/assets/dad_threshold.png"/>Today <a title="Ning!" href="http://www.ning.com/">Ning</a> crossed the dad threshold.  This is the point in time when someone like your dad might actually cross paths with the work you (or your friends) do.

Without you having to say "hey dad, look at this".

I've personally never crossed this point with my own father.  He has a rough idea of what I do, in general terms, maybe, kinda, sorta.  But my work has never directly impacted his life in the least.

Anyhow, I'm a listener of Neal Boortz, a syndicated libertarian radio talk-show host.  I also read <a title="Neal's Nuze" href="http://boortz.com/nuze/200703/03082007.html">his daily news page</a>.  Today he announced <a title="BoortzSpace" href="http://boortz.ning.com/">BoortzSpace</a>, his online community type of thing.  Hosted at <a title="BoortzSpace" href="http://boortz.ning.com/">boortz.ning.com</a>.  This is the sort of thing my own father probably noticed and might actually participate in.

I offer congratulations to <a title="Brian's blog" href="http://kasparov.skife.org/blog/">Brian "Ning" McCallister</a> and the other guys over there at Ning for hitting the beginnings of a possible mass adoption.  They've taken this Web 2.0 thing and seem to have created something broadly useful with it.
