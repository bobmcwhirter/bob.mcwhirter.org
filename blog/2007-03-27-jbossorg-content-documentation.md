Tomek and Mark are working together to figure out our wiki/CMS strategy.  Ultimately, we have the use-cases of
<ul>
	<li>Easy-to-use for developers  community members</li>
	<li>Freakin' pretty to look at</li>
	<li>Browsable through a portlet on jboss.org</li>
	<li>Versioned (just like the code it matches)</li>
	<li>Multiple formats (HTML, PDF)</li>
	<li>Multiple languages</li>
</ul>
We're not sure what form this will all take, but it's the goal.

We have the Red Hat Content Services team available to us, to do localizations.  That gives us the possibility of proof-read documentation in 7 languages.  Not too shabby.

Of course, their tooling works with DocBook.  Some projects certainly might be happy with DocBook, but those preferring the wiki for documentation authoring, the .ORG team will bridge the gap with the Content Services team.

Wikis many times turn into a morass of muck.  Mark and I will concentrate on organizing, grooming and helping to write the docs for the .ORG projects.  Good docs promote  good community.
