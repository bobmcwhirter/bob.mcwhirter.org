This evening, sitting around with my wife and our friend Jeff, he mentioned seeing a crapload of emo kids outside <a title="The Orange Peel" href="http://theorangepeel.net/">a local music venue</a>.  I immediately asked what an emo kid looked like.  My wife suggested the kids from <a title="The OC!" href="http://www.fox.com/oc/">The OC</a>.  Jeff described what sounded to me like followers of <a title="The Cure" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Cure">The Cure</a>.

Luckily, <a title="Emo" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emo_(slang)">Wikipedia's there to save the day</a>.  Then I realized that I'm old, and I don't understand and can't even identify this whole sub-culture of music.  I do like <a title="Death Cab" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_Cab_for_Cutie">Death Cab</a>, but otherwise, I'm ignorant of it all.  Wikipedia at least lets me feign knowledge of current popular culture.

It turns out that emo kids seem to be a mix of <a title="Robert Smith" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Smith_(musician)">Robert Smith</a>-alikes with a little punk thrown in, I guess.

At least I get to see <a title="Les Claypool's site" href="http://www.lesclaypool.com/news/">Les Claypool</a> next week.
