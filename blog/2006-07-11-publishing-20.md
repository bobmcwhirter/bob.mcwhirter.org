</a>Today I had the good fortune to shoot the breeze with Mike Loukides at O'Reilly.  He's working on a new model at O'Reilly, doing less expensive, smaller, and more up-to-date PDF publishing.  I think this is an excellent idea.  The 37signals guys have certainly done well with their PDF publishing, and you simply can't argue about the cost reduction.  Similar to how with <strong>web 2.0</strong> someone can quickly and cheaply produce a new thing, reducing the risk of the effort, a <strong>publishing 2.0</strong> model likewise can harness the, um, long tail (man, I feel dirty just saying it).

So, if you've got the price of a pair of lattes, and the need for some information you probably won't find in a dead-tree book, surf on over to O'Reilly's new <a href="http://www.oreilly.com/store/pdfs.html">PDF library</a> and take a gander.

Of course, I still print stuff out so I can read it while lounging where-ever I care to lounge.
