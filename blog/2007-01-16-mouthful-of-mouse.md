Well, the "5 things" meme has made the rounds.

Last night, what started as a lark has now made it to the far other side of the world. I present the <strong>Mouthful of Mouse</strong> meme. About as useful and intelligent as the "5 things" meme.

Just photograph yourself with a mouse in your mouth. That's it.
Do it!  You <strong>know</strong> you want to!
