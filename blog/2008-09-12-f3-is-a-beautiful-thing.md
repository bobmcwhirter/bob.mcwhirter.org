Code comprehension.  It's important when you jump into someone else's code.

Eclipse makes it easy, with F3, command-T, and shift-command-G.

Very quickly, you can jump through a maze of classes and interfaces, diving into details or seeing the higher hierarchy.  I forgot how nice Eclipse can be.  Particularly if you've got the <a title="viPlugin" href="http://satokar.com/viplugin/">viPlugin</a>.

72 open files (and bless the JBossAS guys for including Eclipse projects and source jars).
