<img align="left" alt="velcro.jpg" id="image57" style="width: 188px; height: 150px" title="velcro.jpg" src="/blog/assets/velcro.jpg"/>This is Velcro.

She was the oldest of the 6 cats who reside in our house.  About 6 years ago, we almost lost her to infection and kidney stones.  She managed to pull through quite well.  This week, she took a downturn.  Collapsed lung.  A mass near her liver.  This morning, while Rebecca was driving her from one veterinarian office to another (which had a better ultrasound), Velcro took her last breath.
Velcro, we love you and miss you dearly.
