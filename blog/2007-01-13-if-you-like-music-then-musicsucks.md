</a>So my friend Joe is one of those crazy cool <a title="Contegix" href="http://www.contegix.com/">Contegix</a> kids.

He's a music maven and has set up a new blog for music stuff, <a title="Music Sucks." href="http://www.musicsucks.net/">Music Sucks</a>.  He's particularly proud of his most recent <a title="Joe interviews Alex" href="http://www.musicsucks.net/2007/01/12/interview-alex-chow-of-islands/">interview with Alex Chow of Islands.</a>

Joe's also invited me to be an occasional guest blogger, so any of my future ramblings about music will appear over there.  Add it to your aggregator henceforth.
