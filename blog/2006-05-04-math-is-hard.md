<img align="right" title="Barbie" id="image30" alt="Barbie" src="/blog/assets/Picture%209.png"/>Seth Godin, the bald leader of the Purple Cow Group (now playing in Vegas three times nightly) has been <a href="http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2006/05/average.html">talking</a> about <a href="http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2006/05/lumpy_curves.html">averages</a> lately.  First, the realization that half the people you may be marketing to are going to be below <a href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/ArithmeticMean.html">average</a>.  Of course, he means they'll be below the <a href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Median.html">median</a>.  He later reminds us of outliers, such as including Bill Gates in any net worth survey.

I think we should also encourage people to not fear math.

Average (or <a href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/ArithmeticMean.html">arithmetic mean</a>), as a statistic, is, well, below average.  The median is a much better metric.  Then you can go hog wild and calculate the <a href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/StandardDeviation.html">standard deviation</a>.  Once you know that, you've got a much clearer picture of what your data represents.  While a median is better than a mean (an average), knowing the variation between points gives you a feel for how (in)consistent your data is.

Bill Gates, Mother Theresa and a steel-worker walk into a pub...

Their average net worth is around $30 billion.

Their median net worth is likely $60,000.

A-ha, you think you're clever, using the median instead of the average.

Then you  figure the standard deviation, give up making any assumptions about this group, and just have a beer with them instead.
