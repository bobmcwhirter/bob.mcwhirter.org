</a>Hat's off to Guillaume and all the other cool kids who pushed Groovy to <a title="Download it!" href="http://groovy.codehaus.org/Download">a 1.0 release</a>.  My original hand-rolled parser is long-gone, but I still wish for the best for these guys.

I think it's cool, too, that they are having <a title="Groovy Party Coordination" href="http://groovy.codehaus.org/Groovy+1.0+parties">concurrent parties across the globe</a> to celebrate.
