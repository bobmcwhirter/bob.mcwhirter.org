</a>Just heard <a href="http://217.31.178.69/vst/arkiv/petter/diamond.mp3">Diamond (link to mp3)</a> by <a href="http://www.bootcut.net/">Bootcut</a> ("The World's Greatest Hammond and Drums Duo") on the radio this afternoon, and thankfully they're progressive enough to have quite a handful of free MP3s available on their site.  They are definitely in the general style of Medeski, Martin  Wood or the Benevento/Russo Duo, but seem slightly more traditional (ie, less masturbatory) in their arrangements.

Check'em out.
