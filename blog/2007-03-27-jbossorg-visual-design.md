<a title="JBoss.ORG" href="http://jboss.org/">JBoss.ORG</a> represents the opensource side of the house.  Though, for some reason, we look just like the commercial side of the house.

You also end up at labs.jboss.com even though you typed jboss.org into your browser.  Quite odd.

No really, we <strong>are</strong> kinda sorta separate from the mothership.

To help differentiate between the two, and try to cement a true mentality of community advocacy, we'll soon be rolling out a new look-and-feel, along with a reorganization of the jboss.org site.  This will actually be a multi-step process, which has already begun with <a title="jira.jboss.org" href="http://jira.jboss.org/">JIRA</a>.

The changes for what we're calling ".ORG 2.0" are not strictly superficial.  Navigation and organization across the board will be much improved, along with a customizable user dashboard.

Additionally, James and his team will be available to projects for doing design work.  They'll also be putting together a style guide with HTML/CSS snippets to make it easier for color-blind geeks with no design sense (that includes me) to put together a nice looking app.  They aren't here just to make the jboss.org site itself pretty.
