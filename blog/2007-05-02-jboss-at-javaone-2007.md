</a>JavaOne is next week.  Would you believe this is the <span style="font-weight: bold">first</span> JavaOne I'll ever have attended?

Some of my colleagues have put together <a title="JBoss at JavaOne 2007" href="http://www.jboss.com/events/javaone07">a page detailing JBoss's participation at the conference</a>.

Speakers from JBoss include <a title="Hibernate Blog" href="http://blog.hibernate.org/cgi-bin/blosxom.cgi">Gavin King and Emmanuel Bernard</a>, <a title="Michael Yuan" href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/search-handle-url/102-8948475-9533755?%5Fencoding=UTF8=ss=books=Michael%20Juntao%20Yuan">Michael Yuan</a>, <a title="Tom's blog" href="http://blogs.jboss.com/blog/tbaeyens/">Tom Baeyens</a> and many others.

I'll be hanging out at Booth #1418 along with James and Mark from my team.  We'll also be wandering the halls talking to anyone who looks like they need some opensource Java love.

Wednesday night, there's going to be <a title="JBoss Party" href="https://www.redhat.com/apps/webform.html?event_type=simple_form=971">a party at the Metreon</a>.  You'll need to go register.
