As my summer winds down, Lance and I are proud to launch <a title="Food Jaunt!" href="http://foodjaunt.com/">Food Jaunt</a>, a directory of local-food providers with reviews, ratings, and maps.  Plus, we point out <a title="Wikipedia: Local Food" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_food">locavore</a> news as we see it.<a title="Local Food: Food Jaunt" href="http://foodjaunt.com/">

For my non-American readers, the US has a tendency to eat food that was grown at least 4 timezones away, and many times from the opposite hemisphere.  That's a long way for fruit to fly.

<a title="Food Jaunt!" href="http://foodjaunt.com/">Food Jaunt</a> aims to support the locavore/<a title="Wikipedia: 100 mile diet" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/100-Mile_Diet">100-mile-diet</a> movement.  Plus, it was just fun to build.
