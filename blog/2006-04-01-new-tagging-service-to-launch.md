For some reason, everyone's definition of 'everything' does not seem to include tags themselves.  We can already tag blog posts, pictures, podcasts and bookmarks.  Soon, you will be able to tag the tags you tag things with.  Imagine the power of the web once you can apply a tag to another tag.  Limited beta will start soon, invitations to A-list taggers are being prepared.
