So, <a title="Pete's blog" href="http://osi.fotap.org/">Pete</a> jammed his mouse into his pie hole:

Thanks Pete!

Pete is also out with a horrible instance of the flu currently.  So, a gentle reminder to <a title="How to wash your hands" href="http://www.ehow.com/how_12779_wash-hands.html">wash your hands</a> <strong>and your mouse</strong> before attempting to ingest it.  And probably wise to do the same again once you're done.
