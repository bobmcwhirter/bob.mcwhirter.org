My friends Trish and Pete <a title="FOTAP!" href="http://fotap.org/blog/2007/07/17/where-to-live-the-eternal-question/">have been thinking about home-ownership</a> lately.

This made me ponder my own abode, and went surfing around.  My little village here has nicely digitized quite a bit of their real-estate records, and made them easily searchable.  I was able to come up with the original plat describing my street and lot, as envisioned in 1914.

Click images to enlarge.

I also came up with the deed, and description of the property.  It almost reads like an obituary. Or a soap-opera.

I think that's awesome.  Alas, the "park" denoted on the original plat a few doors down seems to have been annexed by a neighbor.
