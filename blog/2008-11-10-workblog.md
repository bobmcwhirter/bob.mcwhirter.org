Just when I've trained my boss to read this blog to keep up with my status, I go and <a title="Odd Thesis" href="http://oddthesis.org/">launch another blog</a>, specifically for my workstuff.  In addition to blogs about JBoss things, it'll include other documentation for building, installing and using the related projects.  The projects are grouped into constellations based around theses.  Hence the name:

<a href="http://oddthesis.org/">
  <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-581" title="Odd Thesis" src="/blog/assets/oddthesis-logo-1.png" alt="" width="345" height="57"/>
</a>

In addition to being a new blog, it's also my attempt to eat my own dogfood and prove it all works in the Real World.

The <a title="Odd Thesis" href="http://oddthesis.org/">Odd Thesis</a> site runs entirely on the JBoss-Rails stack.

I'll still blog random crap here at fnokd, but if you're looking for my JBoss experiments, add the <a title="Odd Thesis Atom feed" href="http://oddthesis.org/posts.atom">Odd Thesis feed</a> to your reader.  I've initially imported appropriate posts and comments from this blog.
