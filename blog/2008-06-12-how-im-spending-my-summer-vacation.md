I imagine word has gotten around some already, but I'm on sabbatical from my gig at JBoss/Red Hat.

I stepped down from my role at JBoss.org because I found that I wasn't very good at it.  I gave the idea of "management" the ol' college try and have decided it just doesn't really fit me.  I think I'm still an engineer at heart.

At any rate, to clear my head, spend some time with the family, and pick up some more development chops, I bumped off on this leave-of-absence.

I'm spending a lot of time in my garden and planning an off-the-grid homestead/farm in Virginia.

But I'm no Luddite.

So I'm also pitching in on this local startup <a title="Lance" href="http://greenthumbr.com/members/lance">some</a> <a title="June" href="http://greenthumbr.com/members/june">friends</a> have created, called <a title="Greenthumbr" href="http://greenthumbr.com/">Greenthumbr</a>.

It's a consumer-oriented social-network (yes, another one) for gardeners, farmers, homesteaders, or other organic/eco/green thinkers and doers.

Closed-source, written in Ruby.  A nice change from being management in a Java-centric environment.

So, I'm taking the summer off, ignoring the whole open-source/enterprise world for a while, and broadening my horizons.

We'll see where September finds me. Until then, you can find me in <a title="My Greenthumbr blog" href="http://greenthumbr.com/members/bob">my garden</a>.
