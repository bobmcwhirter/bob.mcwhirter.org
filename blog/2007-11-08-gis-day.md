I've experimented with PostGIS some, so I'm interested to see what's going on.  Here in Asheville, we apparently observe GIS Day on the 9th, with some <a href="http://spreadsheets.google.com/pub?key=pUJkfPwlDiCO5FSbttFzNFw" title="GIS Day Schedule for AB Tech">stuff going on at AB-Tech</a>.

There's a talk on open-source GIS, so I'm curious to see if <a href="http://geotools.codehaus.org/" title="GeoTools">GeoTools</a> or <a href="http://udig.codehaus.org/" title="uDig">uDig</a> are mentioned, being some of the open-source <a href="http://xircles.codehaus.org/tags/gis" title="Codehaus GIS tag">GIS projects at the Codehaus</a>.

Google Maps has shown us how everything goes better with some visual representation.  I think GIS will only grow in importance, and tooling like PostGIS makes it fairly easy.
