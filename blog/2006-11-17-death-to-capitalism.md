Milton was a proponent of controlling the economy by working with the supply-side of the equation.  You have Milton to thank for your 2.185% mortgage.  Ultimately, Milton promoted a clear and free market across the board, with less government regulation and interaction.

He played a role in the abolition of the draft and supported the decriminalization of drugs and prostitution.

Go hug an economist today.
