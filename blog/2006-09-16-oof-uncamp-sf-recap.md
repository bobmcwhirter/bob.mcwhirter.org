</a>Brian Topping had the foresight to bring his digital SLR and document the Oof Uncamp gathering last Tuesday evening.  Attendees included some current and ex-ThoughtWorkers (Paul Hammant, Kurt Schrader), some guy from Ning (Brian McCallister), a cow-orker (Pete Royal) and a VP of something-or-another at Yahoo! (Sam Pullara).  Plus our intrepid photo-historian, Brian Topping.  Random partners and friends-of-friends were inbibing with us.  Click the photo for even more photos.

Conversation ranged from why everything Yahoo! touches is so ugly to ranting about how freaking cold it was that night.  By the time it was all over, Sam was talking about some ideas that involve fleeing the country, never to return.  My reputation as Mr Perma-Beta was re-affirmed, and apparently is to blame for Radar's perma-stealth mode.

Yes, it's all my fault.  I also cause cancer.

We befriended and inducted Cephus and Mongo as honorary hausmates.  We doubt either of them own a computer, but they were nice guys, and the Codehaus Foundation needs some muscle on staff, in case we have some enforcing that needs doing.

Remember kids, any gathering of 3-or-more hausmates is an event.  Or an un-event.  2.0.
