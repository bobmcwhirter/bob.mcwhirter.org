</a>As Movember winds down, I decided to trim my Douglas Coupland/Generation X/Singles goatee into something with more character.  Like last year.

I'm sporting either a French or <a href="http://images.google.com/images?q=john+waters" title="John Waters's Mo">John Waters</a> mo' now.  I'm pretty sure this isn't my wife's favorite look.  But, <strong>my body, my choice</strong>.

And yes, the mustache itself forces me to make that face.  I think it may be sentient or at least possesses occult powers.
