<img src="/blog/assets/swedish_chef.jpg" align="right" height="111" width="79"/>I'm a huge fan of <a href="http://www.tempurpedic.com/" title="Tempur-Pedic">Tempur-Pedic</a> beds.  You know, the original Swedish sleep system using the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory_foam" title="Wikipedia says...">Tempur</a>(tm) material developed for NASA.

I'm just wondering how the Swedes infiltrated our space program to steal NASA's space-age bedding technology, and why we let them get away with it.

The fate of our nation's rest, and maybe our entire space exploration program, is in the hands of quite possibly angry Scandinavians.

It's not like we don't know where Sweden is.  We could quite easily go retrieve our revolutionary sleep technology and re-secure our future in the space race.
