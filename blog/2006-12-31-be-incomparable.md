My oh my, it's tasty stuff.  Archer Farms is just Target's own store brand (aka "generic").  Historically,  store brands have been simply cheaper knock-offs of some brand-name product.  This is still quite prevalent in the cereal aisle, displaying an assortment of <strong>Wheaty Spoonfuls</strong>, <strong>Krispin' Rice</strong>, <strong>Nutty Nuggets</strong> and <strong>Apple-O's</strong>.  You'd buy them to save a few bucks.  Same goes with store-brand sodas, such as <strong>Dr Chek</strong> and <strong>Dr Bob</strong>.

</a>Target has taken the tact of actually producing incomparable products.  I look on the shelf and see a unique bottle containing, of all things, Blueberry-Pomegranate Italian Soda, I start thinking twice if I really want to pick up that case of Pepsi, or even any cola product.  I don't look at the bottle, and think "well, yes, but let me get the brand-name version of Blueberry-Pomegranate soda from the Coca-Cola Corporation."  I gladly spend my money on the "generic" item of something that has no mainstream equivalent.

Target has a guaranteed distribution channel.  They are already considered upscale when compared to Wal-mart, which is probably selling metric tons of Sam's Choice Cola every hour to the penny-pincher.  Why not innovate and try something new?  Plus now, when I get the hankering for some more funky fruit soda, I have to go to Target.
