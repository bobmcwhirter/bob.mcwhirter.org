I'm packing up the grocery-getter and about to roll down to Orlando to get ready for <a href="http://jbossworld.com/" title="JBoss World">JBoss World</a>.  Rebecca Goldstein has worked her fingers to the nub to ensure that this year's JBoss World conference will be awesome.

I'll be working with Karsten Wade of Red Hat <a href="http://developer.redhatmagazine.com/" title="Red Hat Dev-Fu">Dev-Fu</a> to produce daily show reports.  You can also follow along at home through <a href="http://twitter.com/bobmcwhirter" title="Bob's Twitter">my twitter</a>.  If you're at JBW and twitting, leave a comment here with your Twitter URL, so others might can follow you.

See you there!
