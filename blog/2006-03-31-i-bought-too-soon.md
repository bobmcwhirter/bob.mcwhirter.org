</a>I've been working within the dark recesses of rackmount hardware lately.  The bunker doesn't have the best lighting, and I figured I wasn't doing anything else with my forehead, so it'd be a perfect place <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/openxource_bob/118953823/">to strap on a light</a>.  Of course, not a week after I make my investment in head-mounted lighting, I stumble across the <a href="http://www.radtech.us/Products/ISight.aspx">I-Sight</a>.

</a>It seems to always be the case that right after you make a purchase, something better comes along.  Yay capitalism, I guess.  Now, if only someone would merge the I-Sight with a Jabra, and perhaps mix in some wireless audio from my iPod, I'd be set.
