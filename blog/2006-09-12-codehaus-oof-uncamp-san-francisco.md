It has been decided that tonight, 12 September, the Codehaus Oof Uncamp will happen at <a href="http://sanfrancisco.citysearch.com/profile/868351">Zeitgeist</a>, in San Francisco.  It's cash-only, so bring some Benjamins.  I'll buy the first round or two.

<strong>Update</strong>: 7pm is the time to collide.
