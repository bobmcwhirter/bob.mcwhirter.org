It's with some humor I watch the outrage around the London 2012 Olympics logo.  Back in the mid-nineties, I lived in Atlanta.  They were ramping up for the Olympics they were hosting.  And they came up with a "awesome" mascot which was announced with great fanfare.
<div style="text-align: center">

</div>
Yeah, that's inspiring, patriotic, and definitely a gob of blue goo. The idea was that he could morph into lots of things.  It, like the London 2012 logo, seems to have been designed to be open-ended, to encourage "participation" by us random folks or some such, so we could imaging the abstract possibilities of what the mascot/logo <em>could possibly represent</em>.

Logos and mascots are not necessarily group sports.  "Hey honey, let's go look at the logo and imagine what it might be" is not something I say on date night.  They can be witty.  They can be creative.  They can be unexpected.  But they should probably also be straight-forward and not involve any user-serviceable parts.
