There's people out there talking about us and our projects.  They're blogging.  They're writing articles.  They're speaking at conferences.

And we don't necessarily promote them on JBoss.ORG very well yet.

We need to start pointing out to our community when others in the community are speaking.

<a title="del.icio.us social bookmarks" href="http://del.icio.us/">Del.icio.us</a> can help.

Every day, JBoss developers and community members surf the interwebs.  We see things of interest related to our projects.

Now, we just need to tag them as we see them.

Now, we trust Adam, Mark and James.  We don't necessarily trust Larry and Moe or the rest of the world.  So we get back to our fancy RSS aggregating, and moderate folks we don't trust, and auto-approve those we do.  Ultimately, we end up with a "sightings" page back at the project's JBoss.ORG page.

A del.icio.us feed is normally fairly barren, including just a link and a title.  Very few folks use the description field.  So, we'll try to annotate links with an abstract or comment, to add some value.  Might also be cool to inject a thumbnail snapshot of the tagged site, to help preview what it points to.

We'll be coming up with a psuedo-structured tagging system for developers and community members to use, along with the underlying software to drive the aggregation.
