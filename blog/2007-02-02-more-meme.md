Well, after the illness suffered by Pete, I thought the mouthful of mouse meme might've been dealt a death blow.  Or at least a feel-like-death blow.

Then came <a title="Karen Marcelo: Bandwidth Waster" href="http://karenmarcelo.org/">Karen Marcelo</a>.  She's a <a title="bless you" href="http://www.sethgodin.com/ideavirus/">sneezer</a> with a camera and a mission.  She's also a cow-orker, a cool <a title="things aflame" href="http://www.srl.org/">SRL</a> person, and the <a title="dorkbot-sf" href="http://dorkbot.org/dorkbotsf/">dorkbot-sf</a> poobah.

Which, by the way, isn't picking up every tagged photo.  Probably has to something to do with Yahoo! being pure evil, taking away the old skool login.  Yeah, that must be it.</p>
<p align="left">It's interesting to watch the meme morph.  Some folks had to adjust for corded mice.  Some tried a side-saddle mouthification.  Pretty evenly split as to if the participant used a hand to support the mouse, or if it was completely supported using just the jaws.</p>
