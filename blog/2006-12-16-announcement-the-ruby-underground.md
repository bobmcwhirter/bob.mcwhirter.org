Following on the heels of my <a href="/blog/karma-columnist">last post</a>, I'd like to announce the <a href="http://rubyunderground.org/">Ruby Underground</a>.  It's simply a selective aggregator of Ruby blogger content.  There's already plenty of sources for generic ruby content.  Tons of 20-something youngsters (yes, I'm old) are out there talking about Ruby on Rails and such.

The Ruby Underground tries to address a slightly different audience.  Thus far, all contributors to the underground are either current or former Java hackers.  They've been around the block a time or two and feel squeamish watching all the SQL that ActiveRecord throws.  Yet, they have an affinity to the beauty of Ruby.

While "<strong>enterprisey</strong>" is typically a derisive term, I think the Ruby community could use some "<strong>enterpriseyness</strong>" to help bring it, um, to the enterprise.

Anyhow, the <a href="http://rubyunderground.org/">Ruby Underground</a>, as noted, is just an aggregator.  If you already read Bob, Brian, Dion, Kurt, Lance, Martin, Paul and Simon, it probably has nothing to offer you.  On the other hand, you'll miss out when other bloggers are invited to be contributors.
