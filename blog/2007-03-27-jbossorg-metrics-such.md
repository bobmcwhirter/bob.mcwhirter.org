If you don't measure, you can't tell if you're doing things right or wrong.

You can measure downloads (accounting for spiders, bots and attacks), site visits, RSS subscriptions, site registrations, forum posts.  All sorts of things.

You can measure how many issues are opening in JIRA versus those that were closed in the last week.  Or the average lifespan of an issue.

We'll be working with the Release Engineering group to straighten out the download repositories and make it easy for projects to deploy nightlies, snapshots and official releases into repositories we can accurately measure.

We're going to be looking at providing more robust web stats.

In general, metrics are desired by all stakeholders, both commercial (marketing and PR) and the community (how healthy and active is this project)?

Sorry, no fancy visual aids for this one.
