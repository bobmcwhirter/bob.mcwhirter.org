<img src="/blog/assets/picture-10.png" align="right" height="74" width="135"/>Every year there is a time that men can put aside their differences, stop their fighting, and do some good.

This important time of year is <a href="http://www.movember.com/" title="Movember">Movember</a>.

Grow a mustache and help raise awareness for men's health issues.

Last year, I cheated, by simply shaving down an existing beard into a mustache.  This year, I started clean-shaven (a day late, even).  So far, I'm just stubbly, but will probably shave this weekend to reveal the mustache within.

Have fun with facial hair!
