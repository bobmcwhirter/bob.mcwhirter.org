As a child, a friend of mine (my Attorney) and I were in the local paper for building a sprawling Lego city across my rumpus room.

This morning, my son continued the legacy, by winning a bring-your-own-Lego(tm) Transformer(tm)-construction competition.

The Asheville Citizen-Times <a title="Son in the paper" href="http://www.citizen-times.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=200770825043">wrote it up nicely</a>.
<blockquote>HENDERSONVILLE &#xE2;&#x20AC;&#x201C; For Noah McWhirter, building Lego figures just comes natural.

&#xE2;&#x20AC;&#x153;I just build things with my wild imagination,&#xE2;&#x20AC;&#x9D; the 10-year-old Vance Elementary School fourth-grader said. &#xE2;&#x20AC;&#x153;I don&#xE2;&#x20AC;&#x2122;t even think about them. I just make them.&#xE2;&#x20AC;&#x9D;</blockquote>

Of course, I think part of the winning strategy was bringing <span style="font-weight: bold">The Intimidator</span> Professional-Grade Toolbox, when most kids had some flimsy Tupperware or burlap sack.  Bonus points for packing it to the gills with 1970s-era Lego(tm), inherited from dear ol' dad.
