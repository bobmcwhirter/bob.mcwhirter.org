Tonight, the fine folks on the JBoss.org team managed to reach a significant milestone.  In fact, JBoss.org is now actually hosted at <a href="http://jboss.org/" title="JBoss.org">http://jboss.org/</a>.  Imagine that!  We'd been satisfied living at <strong>http://labs.jboss.com/</strong> for quite a while, so this is a nice change.

Additionally, <a href="http://wiki.jboss.org/" title="wiki.jboss.org">http://wiki.jboss.org/</a> has been moved off the old Nukes wiki and onto a more modern wiki.  Along with being merged with the wiki that used to live at <strong>http://labs.jboss.com/wiki</strong>.  Like many organizations, we'd ended up with too many.  We probably still have too many.  But now we have one fewer.  You can thank <a href="http://szimano.org/" title="Tomek's blog">Tomek</a> for that.

Probably the coolest bit of tonight's update is  the <a href="http://www.jboss.org/feeds/" title="JBoss.org feeds">new feeds subsystem</a> created by Adam.  You can check it out, and notice that you can now submit a blog for inclusion in our aggregator.  Project leads have more control over their project's aggregator, and we're archiving everything we touch, now.
