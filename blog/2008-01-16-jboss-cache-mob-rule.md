Yes, yes, I know it's surprising that the superstars at JBoss might possibly write some buggy code.  But we don't <em>always</em> get a full 8 hours of sleep and a complete, nutritious breakfast.  Plus, sometimes elves sneak in at night and play dirty tricks on us.

None-the-less, there's some bugs needing squishing.

<a href="http://labs.jboss.com/jbosscache/monthOfBugs/Jan2008/Month_of_Bugs/Month_of_Bugs.html" title="MoB announcement">Check the  announcement</a> for all the details, but bottom line is you've got 30 days (until <a href="http://jbossworld.com/" title="JBoss World">JBoss World</a>) to find and/or fix as many bugs as you can.  For that, <strong>valuable prizes may be awarded</strong>.
