</a>This weekend I acquired a <a href="http://www.cingular.com/8125_consumer">new toy</a>.  Those of you who follow my <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/openxource_bob/">Flickr</a> might've noticed slightly less fuzzy photos streaming in.  This is actually the first Windows machine I've purchased for myself.  Previously I had tried a <a href="http://www.sharpusa.com/products/TypeLanding/0,1056,112,00.html">Zaurus</a>, but it quickly became a paperweight, due to its size and lack of phone capabilities.

The Cingular 8125, though, has Bluetooth, wifi, GPRS/EDGE and voice talents, all in a package ultimately not much larger than the  Nokia 6620 it replaces.  Though, it's certainly no RAZR, and has quite a bit of heft to it.  Being that I'm <a href="http://www.gigantor.org/">Gigantor</a>-sized, it fits quite well in my pocket.  The keyboard is quite usable for my big honkin' thumbs, even.

Along with the device, I signed up for Cingular's PDA plan, so I can use the GPRS/EDGE connection all willy-nilly unlimitedly.  My Sunday was spent playing with <a href="http://pm-doc.sourceforge.net/">Procmail</a> recipes trying to filter and route the appropriate set of emails to the pocket machine.
