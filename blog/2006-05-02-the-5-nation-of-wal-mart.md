</span><span class="imagelink">Today, a friend of mine asked me write an endorsement for him on <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/">LinkedIn</a>.  I hadn't been to LinkedIn in a while, so surfed around for a tad, and noticed a new feature.  LinkedIn lets you know the localities of your network.  As you can see here, I've got links to the Pillippines, Korea, and, um, Fayetteville, Arkansas.  </span>

Yes, that's Arkansas.  Turns out that Wal-Mart is has the same influence (or more?) as some small countries.
