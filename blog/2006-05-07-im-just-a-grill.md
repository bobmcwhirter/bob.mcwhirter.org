</a>Today marked the first day of grilling season up here in the Appalachians. For some reason, nothing is quite as satisfying as dousing some brickets with some volatile organic compounds and setting it all aflame. The forced relaxation that comes with waiting for the perfect coals is to be savored. I could probably make an analogy about not rushing software development, but really, I just like playing with fire.

(That's the official Codehaus grill, procured for the <a href="http://www.codehaus.org/Second+Irregular+Haus+Party">Codehaus Incendiary Summer Front-Porch Conference</a> two years ago.)
