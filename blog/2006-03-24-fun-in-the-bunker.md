</a>I've become the admin for a growing number of machines for my <a href="http://www.radarnetworks.com/">day job</a>, hidden away in our underground bunker, deep within one of the appalachian mountains.  It's been a while since I've played with hardware, since I've become a fan of the Apple Macs.  Macs, having virtually no user-serviceable parts, let you forget about hardware.  Right now, though, I <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/openxource_bob/sets/72057594089237049/">definitely cannot forget about the hardware</a>.
