Henri Yanell <a title="Henri speaks" href="http://www.fnokd.com/2007/02/16/community-event-horizons/#comment-10533">made some comments</a> on my previous post.  I interpreted them to mean something like the following:

Within a project's community, one or more companies may spring forth from the project.  They share the same community and prospects, and their customers may overlap.  (Overlapping customers not shown).

Additionally. within a thriving community exists other providers, perhaps not even directly tied to the project, yet participating in its community.

Of course, depending on the magnification of your view into any community, individuals can be playing different roles.  While a project has a community of users, the project itself may participate in the community of the specification it implements.   <a title="Apache Tomcat" href="http://tomcat.apache.org/">Tomcat</a> and <a title="Jetty" href="http://jetty.mortbay.org/">Jetty</a> are both participants in the greater <a title="Servlets" href="http://java.sun.com/products/servlet/download.html">Java Servlet specification</a> community, as are their own users.  But within the scope of the individual projects, their communities are distinct.

This is where being "technology agnostic" pays off.  By not explicitly aligning with a subset of a larger community, the size of your prospects stays larger.

I don't think I'll even try to drawn a comprehensive diagram of overlapping subsets, such as "Portlet Vendors specializing in AS/400 portlets".  I'll leave that to <a title="John Venn" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venn_diagram">John Venn</a>.
