There are times that I realize I haven't directed my own music choices for a while.  Maybe I've been traveling, spending all day on the phone, or simply driving down the road with the radio inadvertently tuned to KRAP-FM.

And I find my motivation waning, my creativity lacking, and my general happiness in deficit.  Music matters to me.  But even then, I'll have trouble finding the <strong>right</strong> music to listen to.  Somehow the 26.5 days of music jammed into iTunes just is not sufficient.  The online streams seem off.

But then there are days like today, when my wife introduced me to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jose_Gonzales" title="Wikipedia says...">Jos&#x9807;onz&#x1B25;z</a>.  This man sings exactly the right way for today.  Plus the video has a creepy pigman.
