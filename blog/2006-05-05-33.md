</a>I'd realized that my last blog praising the guys at <a title="Contegix!" href="http://www.contegix.com/">Contegix</a> existed only on my now-nuked old Typo-powered blog.  And these guys rock so much that I wanted to make sure I had some praise for them still existing on the interwebs.  So, to reiterate, Contegix kicks ass.  As a managed-hosting provider, there is nothing more I could ask for.

It's 3am, and you decide you want a web-stats package installed on your server?  By 3:15am, it's completed.  It's always business hours at Contegix, and I can't remember the last time any request too more than 15 minutes from my initial email to having it completed.   I'm a customer 3-times-over with Contegix, between the <a title="The Codehaus" href="http://www.codehaus.org/">Codehaus</a>, <a title="Radar Networks" href="http://www.radarnetworks.com/">Radar Networks</a>, and <a title="You're soaking in it." href="http://www.fnokd.com/">my own personal machinations</a>.
One day I'll make it to <a title="St Louise is listening" href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q=en=st.+louis=1">St. Louis</a> to have beers with Matthew, Craig, Joe, Tony and the other folks there who keep my servers alive and sane.
