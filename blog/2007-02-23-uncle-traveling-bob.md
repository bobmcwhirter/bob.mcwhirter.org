</a>I'm going to be in Austin, Texas all next week for the <a title="JBoss.ORG" href="http://jboss.org/">Day Job</a>.  Seems like most folks I used to know in Austin have moved to Houston or other places.  If you are in Austin, and particularly if you want to buy me some beers, <a title="Contact Bob" href="http://www.fnokd.com/about/">let me know</a>.

I don't know the area, but it seems I'll be near the <a title="Somewhere in Austin" href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q=en=3410+Far+West+Boulevard,+Austin=37.0625,-95.677068=53.696917,106.171875=UTF8=15=30.352139,-97.750168=0.028886,0.065918=1">Northwest District Park</a>.
