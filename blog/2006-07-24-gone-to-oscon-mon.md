</a>Well, I've managed to procure both travel and lodging for <a title="OSCon Portland, 2006" href="http://conferences.oreillynet.com/os2006/">OSCon in Portland this week</a>.  I still don't actually have a conference pass, but what is life without challenges?  If you're an exhibitor or just a friendly soul who has a spare pass or would like to sponsor me, email <strong>bob@</strong> this domain.

I'm arriving around lunchtime on Wednesday, and departing at the break of day on Friday.  I think I'm going to the Jive Software party.  Henri Yandell has suggested a haus party on Wednesday night, but we'll see how things pan out.  I can be SMS'd on my shoephone, which can be found on my <a title="Contact Bob" href="http://www.fnokd.com/about/">contact page</a>.
