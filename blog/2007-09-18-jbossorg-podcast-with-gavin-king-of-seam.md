Back at JavaOne, the team and I chased down Gavin and <a title="Podcast with Gavin" href="http://labs.jboss.com/jbosslabs/transcripts/King_JavaOne2007.html">made him speak</a> on Seam, Web Beans (JSR-299), Groovy, Grails, and two-wheeled forms of transportation.

We've also <a title="Transcript of Podcast with Gavin" href="http://labs.jboss.com/jbosslabs/transcripts/King_JavaOne2007.html">included a transcript</a>, since both Gavin and Mark have those funny accents.
