</a>Today, being a lazy Sunday, I surfed over to 37Signals and picked up a copy of <a href="https://gettingreal.37signals.com/">Getting Real</a>.  I know I'm a few weeks late on this meme, but I truly enjoyed the book.

On the surface, after reading 177 pages, you could easily think that there was nothing concretely useful in the book.  You could, but that'd be silly.  The whole book enforces a different attitude.  It's about agility, not only in development or management, but in the vision of the product you're producing.  The best quote, I think is
<blockquote>Stick to what&#xE2;&#x20AC;&#x2122;s truly essential. Good ideas can be tabled. Take whatever you think your product should be and cut it in half. Pare features down until you&#xE2;&#x20AC;&#x2122;re left with only the most essential ones. Then do it again.</blockquote>
Ultimately, stop thinking about producing, and simply go produce.  As my dad says, "the enemy of 'good' is 'better.'"  The essence of your product is probably good (or you can hope). Alas, the desire to make it better can work against you, creating feature overload, delayed schedules, and a lack of focus in the vision.  Get on with it already.
