I'm not a morning person by default. Life claims otherwise, though, so 
I've had to figure out how to wake up at a reasonable hour.  Which is
even more difficult when you throw in a little jet lag.

I play the typical games of setting my alarm 9, 18, or 27 minutes
earlier than my target wake time.  This gives me at least 1, 2 or
3 snooze cycles before having to drag my self out from the warm
embrace of sleep.

Though, I'm amazed at how efficiently my sleep can adjust to a regular
9 minute interruption, and blow right on past my target wake time.

At best, I'm 9 minutes late.  Sometimes it's more like 27.

I use my iPhone as my alarm clock, docked next to the bed. Thankfully, 
it allows for multiple alarms. I've now taken to setting my typical
N-snooze alarm, to gently ease me towards getting up.  But now I also
set a secondary *backup* alarm a mere two minutes after I really want
to be awake.

By breaking the 9 minute cycle, the quick secondary alarm is like
your mother standing over you, not letting you sleep the day away.

When the 2-after alarm goes off, my mind registers that I'm "late"
since it's after the target time, but I'm not panicked since I'm not
*that* late.  Yet.

This is what I do to most successfully get up around 7am.
