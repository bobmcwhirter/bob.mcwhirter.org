I just unsubscribed from a pushy seed company's daily email newsletter.

Really?  <strong>72 business hours</strong>?  There are 8 business hours a day, 40 in a week (good thing they aren't French). That could take up to 9 business days, which is a minimum of <strong>11 calendar days</strong>.

Could be as many as 13, if you catch two weekends upside the head.  Sweet.

Now that's service.
