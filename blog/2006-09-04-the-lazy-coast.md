</a>My <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/openxource_bob/233318870/">luxurious jet-set lifestyle</a> is taking me to the <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q=en=san+francisco=UTF8=8=37.09024,-123.579712=3.365033,8.415527=1">San Francisco</a> area in a week.  September 10th through the 14th, I'll be in the general area of all things 2.0.  I'm truly excited to finally get to meet my coworkers.  Yes, I've worked for <a href="http://www.radarnetworks.com/">Radar Networks</a> for just about a year now.  No, I've never met a single coworker while employed with Radar Networks.  I have <a href="http://www.fotap.org/gallery/2003/october/hausparty/">met</a> <a title="Pete's Blog" href="http://osi.fotap.org/">Peter Royal</a> before, but that was before either of us worked for the company.

I am tentatively thinking of a <strong>Tuesday (12 September)</strong> evening <em><a href="http://xircles.codehaus.org/">Codehaus</a> Oof Uncamp Conference 2.0</em>, where hausmates, sympathizers, collaborators and detractors can gather to do no camping but rather consume some <a href="http://beermapping.com/">
  <em>Beers 2.0</em>
</a>.  Though, who knows.  Maybe we'll do it Wednesday, or Sunday.  We're <a href="http://www.agilealliance.org/">agile</a>.

Locals will need to suggest some good location and pick <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/openxource_bob/233318968/">my ass</a> up near Chinatown.
