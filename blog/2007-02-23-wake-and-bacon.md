<a title="Wake and Bacon" href="http://www.mathlete.com/portfolio/wakeNbacon.php"><img width="196" height="147" align="right" alt="wake-bacon-open.jpg" id="image179" title="wake-bacon-open.jpg" src="/blog/assets/wake-bacon-open.jpg"/>This is a fantastic idea.</a>

It's an alarm clock in the form of a pig's head.  It is no ordinary pig-head-shaped alarm clock, though. Instead of buzzing, it gently wakes you up by delivering some hot and delicious bacon to you.

Bacon!

How can that be wrong?

It's basically just an alarm clock that has had the buzzer re-routed to some halogen lamps that pull an <a title="Easy Bake" href="http://www.hasbro.com/default.cfm?page=cs_recall_eb_oven">Easy-Bake</a> on the bacon.  Or course, you'll need the matching Sleep-and-Freeze to store your spare frozen bacon rounds, ready for loading each night.

I imagine the vegetarian model, which tosses a salad, will be significantly less successful in waking people up.
