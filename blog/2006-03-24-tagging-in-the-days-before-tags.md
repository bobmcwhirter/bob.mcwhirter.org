Back in the day, my friend <a href="http://www.yak.net/">Strick</a> wanted a way for all of his friends to associate themselves together, even if they perhaps did not know one another.  Effectively, the idea was to have a friends-of-Strick tag that could be distributedly applied by each of his friends to their own sites and servers.

Strick accomplished this by inventing a new word, such as <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=frobnovich-1">frobnovich-1</a> or <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=qwertyak">qwertyak</a>, and having folks plonk them on their pages (such as I just did).  Then it's just a matter of plugging these tags into AltaVista (and later Google) to see who is part of Strick's social cloud.

This was back in 1997, if I recall.

Of course, folks play games with Google, trying to find queries that return exactly 1 result, or folks will Google-bomb a term to push an alternative (typically making a social or political statement) result to the top of the list.  But for 1997, before the tag-everything days of Web 2.0, I think Strick had himself a pretty good idea.

Strick wrote a FAQ about <a href="http://www.techwood.org/fqa/66.html">altavistaincantation</a>.
