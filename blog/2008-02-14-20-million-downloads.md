At the keynote today, Craig Muzilla, the co-GM of JBoss Division, let us know that we've seen over 20,000,000 downloads, now.  That breaks down to about 10 million before the acquisition (5 years), and about 10 million since then (20 months).

If this were a constant stream of downloads, that'd be over 8000/day, for over 6 and a half years.  Over 300 and hour, or 5 a second.

But it wasn't linear.  Since the acquisition, it's been more like 16.5k downloads a day, across our product lines.
