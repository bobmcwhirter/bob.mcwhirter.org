To be honest, I'm not that much of a <a title="Smashing Pumpkins" href="http://www.smashingpumpkins.com/">Smashing Pumpkins</a> fan, but I think it's cool that they're breaking out of the normal box, and doing a rather odd tour this year.  They've picked 2 cities to have a "residency" at.  One of them is my town, Asheville, North Carolina.

9 shows between 23-June and 5-July at <a title="The Orange Peel" href="http://theorangepeel.net/">The Orange Peel</a>.

They aren't just rolling into town, playing a show, and retreating to the next stop under the cover of darkness.

It's a freakin' <strong>13 day event</strong>.

Of course, events mean people.  And people mean social networks.  I guess.

Nonetheless, once again <a title="Ning!" href="http://www.ning.com/">Ning</a> pops up as the implementation behind <a title="Smasheville.com" href="http://smasheville.com/">Smasheville.com</a>.  Go Ning go!
