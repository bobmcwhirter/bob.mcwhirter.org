<img width="159" height="121" align="left" alt="circle.gif" id="image142" title="circle.gif" src="/blog/assets/circle.gif"/><a title="Joe's blog" href="http://www.joeandmotorboat.com/">Joe</a> invited me to blog at <a title="Music Sucks." href="http://www.musicsucks.net/">Music Sucks</a>.  And now I've started.  But going back to wanting to earn karma for all of my blogging, I'm now reverse-syndicating my blog posts from Music Sucks.  They all end up back here within an hour or two of going live at Music Sucks.

No comments or trackbacks are allowed at this end, and the permalinks point back directly to Music Sucks.

I'm also hoping that perhaps <a title="lijit" href="http://www.lijit.com/">lijit</a> can help me out some, since it seems to maybe be heading in roughly the right direction, in gathering all of my feeds.  We'll see how that works out.  Ultimately, I'd like anything I do that produces useful RSS to end up back here.  We'll see what sort of tangled network I can come up with.
