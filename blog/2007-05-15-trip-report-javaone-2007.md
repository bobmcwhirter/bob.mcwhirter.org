I got back from my first ever JavaOne, and I'd have to say it was a success.

First the obligatory "look how cool I am" section...
<h2>Name dropping</h2>
<h3>Misc</h3>
Drank too much with <a title="BileBlog" href="http://www.bileblog.org/">Hani of the BileBlog</a>.

Met innumerable coworkers whos names all fail me during my stints in or near the JBoss booth.

The fabulous Cindy Scheneck, Rebecca Goldstein and Chantal Yang arranged the booth, the party, the printing of the t-shirts and everything else that made it all awesome.  Mad props to that trio, Burr Sutter, and the gaggle of sales-engineers who did an awesome job with the attendees.
<h2>Observations</h2>
With the large investment announced by Interface21, a lot of side-line analysis of business models was happening. Exactly where is the sweet spot of professional opensource?  Is it training?  Certifying a stack that you control?  Supporting a stack that you don't?  Purely professional services?

At the booth, technical demos seemed well received. A large screen and a good sound-system were definitely a wise investment.  Every demo drew a large crowd around the booth.  A lucky few got to see Gavin debug a demo live on stage.  Seam is definitely hot this year.

Luckier still are those who "received" a "free" copy of <a title="Michael's Book" href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0131347969/mobileenterpr-20/">Michael Yuan's book about Seam</a>.  Did I mention Seam is apparently hot?

We all need to realize that parties can occur on nights other than Wednesday.  Luckily the JBoss-&gt;Eclipse-&gt;Google triathlon worked out, but many parties were concurrently scheduled.

I heard a lot of positive feedback from people I met about liking what we're doing at JBoss.org.  They like the new look and layout.  When it's common for people to throw around criticism and negativity, it's really nice to hear kind words.  Sure, we've still got a long way to go, I'll readily admit, but I think we're doing a-okay.

In general, conferences like these are somewhat educational, definition inspirational, and help cement human-to-human relationships.  While we all might be competitors, we're not <strong>enemies</strong>.  In the world of opensource, we share the same community, so we all might as well get along and order another round of beers.  Conferences demonstrate these cross-cutting commonalities that crosses P statements.
