After fighting with backups (check your backups, kids!), we've started getting the haus back online.  Subversion repositories are back, read-only over HTTP at <a href="http://svn.codehaus.org/">http://svn.codehaus.org/</a>, the various distribution repos are back, such as <a href="http://dist.codehaus.org/">http://dist.codehaus.org/</a>.  We did lose some commits in the SVN, and some deployments may be missing from dist.  Now's the time to sanity-check.

We're continuing to work to get CVS, mail, and read/write access to Subversion back as soon as possible.

We truly appreciate all of the efforts to help, and your patience has been outstanding.  We realize how painful downtime is.
