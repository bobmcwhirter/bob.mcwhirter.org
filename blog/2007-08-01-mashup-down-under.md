<img width="161" height="151" align="right" alt="Picture 13.png" id="image285" title="Picture 13.png" src="/blog/assets/Picture%2013.png"/>Mike "JIRA JIRA JIRA" Cannon-Brookes pinged me on IM tonight to let me know that <a title="Atlassian buys Cenqua" href="http://www.atlassian.com/cenqua/default.jsp?s_kwcid=HMcenqua">Atlassian has acquired Cenqua</a>.  Cenqua, as you might know, makes the fancy-dandy FishEye product for viewing source repositories.  Atlassian is the Australian wiki/bug-tracking giant run by stylish surfers.

Congrats to both groups.  I enjoyed having beers with the Cenqua kids at JavaOne this year.
