<span class="imagelink"/>If you use WordPress and occasionally link to an mp3, you're creating an implicit podcast.

</span>Poking around, I realized that iTunes would consume the <a title="Wikipedia for RSS" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS_(file_format)">RSS</a> 2.0 feed from WordPress as a podcast, and load up the first mentioned <a title="Wikipedia for mp3" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MP3">mp3</a> in a given entry as the podcast.  If you link to multiple mp3s, alas only the first is caught, at least by iTunes.  It doesn't seem to want to play friendly with multiple enclosures per entry.

Or maybe I'm just doing it wrong.

So I now get random new music loaded onto my iPod by giving iTunes <a title="RSS 2 feed for Music Sucks." href="http://www.musicsucks.net/feed/rss2/">the RSS 2.0 feed</a> from <a title="Music Sucks." href="http://www.musicsucks.net/">Music Sucks.</a>

Funnily enough, even the founder of the site didn't know it was producing a podcast for him.  I think it's key that the technology has gotten to the point where someone who blogs about music magically gets a podcast.

It just makes sense.
