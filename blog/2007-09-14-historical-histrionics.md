My friend Lance, here in Asheville, hacks for <a title="Electric Sheep Company" href="http://www.electricsheepcompany.com/">Electric Sheep Company</a> during the day, and by night is actor extraordinaire.

Starting next week, the <a title="immediate theatre project's Copenhagen" href="http://www.immediatetheatre.org/copenhagen/index.htm">immediate theatre project</a> will be presenting <strong>Copenhagen</strong>, with Lance playing the physicist <a title="Wikipedia on Heisenberg" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Werner_Heisenberg">Werner Heisenberg</a>.  The play centers around a meeting (in Copenhagen) that occurred between the seemingly at-odds scientists during the war.

Lance says he has most of his lines mostly memorized, so far.  Should be fun!
