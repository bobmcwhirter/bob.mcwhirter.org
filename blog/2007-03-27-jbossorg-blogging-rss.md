To say that "blogging" at JBoss has been contentious would be an understatement.  There's currently two different places/ways of blogging at JBoss.  And one of them allows blog posts to go missing without a trace. (Thanks Blojsom!)

Ultimately, software to allow humans to blog isn't overly interesting, until you get to the point of wacky plugins and skins and other frills folks have come to expect.

Additionally, folks have a certain mindset when they write on the corporate JBoss blog, which is different from when writing on their own blog.  I think personal blogging, even on corporate topics, tends to be more real and honest.  These "off-shore" outposts also help increase the organization's footprint on the interwebs.

Given all of that...

JBoss developers who want to blog, I highly recommend <a title="blogspot.com" href="http://blogspot.com/">blogspot.com</a>, <a title="typepad.com" href="http://typepad.com/">typepad.com</a> or <a title="wordpress.com" href="http://wordpress.com/">wordpress.com</a>.  I just ask that you use tagging or categories to allow fine-grained aggregation of your JBoss-related content.

The blogging effort within JBoss.ORG is being re-doubled to focus on fancy twiddling of RSS nine ways to Sunday.

We're not simply talking about normal aggregation, oh no.  We're talking <strong>fancy</strong>.

First, lots of other tools produce RSS, including JIRA and Fisheye.  Each project's presence on JBoss.ORG will start being a nexus for this implicit RSS that's being thrown around.  Add a dollop of styling and some RSS portlets, and projects can easily display issues-remaining for the next release, follow changes by developers or on branches, or all sorts of things.  We like information overload.

Also, we have content in the wiki and in the forums.  Perhaps an RSS feed of an entire forum would be overwhelming.  The intersection of the forum feed and a tag feed, though, provides a nicely filtered view of the forum.  Developers will be able to tag forum posts as "blogworthy" and magically have a blog produced from their posting.

We have a content team (hi Mark) that needs a way to watch and respond to a lot of what goes on in the community.  Developers answer a forum question that obviously should be in the FAQ, they tag it and move on with their life.  We can watch the tags, read the forum, and extract a FAQ.

Information is everywhere.  And this information represents contributions, in one way or another, by our community.  RSS thankfully is a great way to work with diverse information in a consistent way.

And when I say RSS, I probably mean Atom, honestly.
