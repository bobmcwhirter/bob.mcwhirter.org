Just a couple of quick notes:

Max and the <a href="http://labs.jboss.com/tools/" title="JBoss Tools">JBoss Tools</a> team have <a href="http://labs.jboss.com/tools/download/index.html" title="Download JBoss Tools">released version 2.01</a>.  What I personally find exciting is that this release sees bundles for OSX. The JBoss Tools project is what ultimately feeds into the <a href="http://www.jboss.com/products/devstudio" title="JBoss Developer Studio">JBoss Developer Studio</a>, so you know it's good stuff.

Also, Tom, Koen and the jBPM team (with the assistance of the .org designers) have published <a href="http://labs.jboss.com/jbossjbpm/" title="jBPM">an updated site</a> that includes a fancy new logo and some diagrams to help you get your footing in the world of BPM.
