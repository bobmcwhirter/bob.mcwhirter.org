<img width="168" height="119" align="left" title="Picture 3.png" id="image22" alt="Picture 3.png" src="/blog/assets/Picture%203.png"/>Last night I managed to pick up <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0007YMUGQ/">Best Reason to Buy the Sun</a> by the <a href="http://www.beneventorussoduo.com/">Benevento/Russo Duo</a>.  Purely instrumental, they are an odd cross of Medeski, Martin  Wood, Death Cab for Cutie, and The Bad Plus.  For me, at least, it's one of the best CDs to sling code or manipulate a spreadsheet to.  I'm amazed at what two guys can do.  There's the guy on the drums, and the guy on the keys.  And it's a wall of intricate sound much of the time.
